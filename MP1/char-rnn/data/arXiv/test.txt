Title: DPSNet: End-to-end Deep Plane Sweep Stereo
Abstract:  Multiview stereo aims to reconstruct scene depth from images acquired by a camera under arbitrary motion. Recent methods address this problem through deep learning, which can utilize semantic cues to deal with challenges such as textureless and reflective regions. In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network called DPSNet (Deep Plane Sweep Network) whose design is inspired by best practices of traditional geometry-based approaches for dense depth reconstruction. Rather than directly estimating depth and/or optical flow correspondence from image pairs as done in many previous deep learning methods, DPSNet takes a plane sweep approach that involves building a cost volume from deep features using the plane sweep algorithm, regularizing the cost volume via a context-aware cost aggregation, and regressing the dense depth map from the cost volume. The cost volume is constructed using a differentiable warping process that allows for end-to-end training of the network. Through the effective incorporation of conventional multiview stereo concepts within a deep learning framework, DPSNet achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction results on a variety of challenging datasets. 

Title: Morphology-Agnostic Visual Robotic Control
Abstract:  Existing approaches for visuomotor robotic control typically require characterizing the robot in advance by calibrating the camera or performing system identification. We propose MAVRIC, an approach that works with minimal prior knowledge of the robot's morphology, and requires only a camera view containing the robot and its environment and an unknown control interface. MAVRIC revolves around a mutual information-based method for self-recognition, which discovers visual "control points" on the robot body within a few seconds of exploratory interaction, and these control points in turn are then used for visual servoing. MAVRIC can control robots with imprecise actuation, no proprioceptive feedback, unknown morphologies including novel tools, unknown camera poses, and even unsteady handheld cameras. We demonstrate our method on visually-guided 3D point reaching, trajectory following, and robot-to-robot imitation. 

Title: PLG-IN: Pluggable Geometric Consistency Loss with Wasserstein Distance in Monocular Depth Estimation
Abstract:  We propose a novel objective for penalizing geometric inconsistencies to improve the depth and pose estimation performance of monocular camera images. Our objective is designed using the Wasserstein distance between two point clouds, estimated from images with different camera poses. The Wasserstein distance can impose a soft and symmetric coupling between two point clouds, which suitably maintains geometric constraints and results in a differentiable objective. By adding our objective to the those of other state-of-the-art methods, we can effectively penalize geometric inconsistencies and obtain highly accurate depth and pose estimations. Our proposed method is evaluated using the KITTI dataset. 

Title: DeepVIO: Self-supervised Deep Learning of Monocular Visual Inertial Odometry using 3D Geometric Constraints
Abstract:  This paper presents an self-supervised deep learning network for monocular visual inertial odometry (named DeepVIO). DeepVIO provides absolute trajectory estimation by directly merging 2D optical flow feature (OFF) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Specifically, it firstly estimates the depth and dense 3D point cloud of each scene by using stereo sequences, and then obtains 3D geometric constraints including 3D optical flow and 6-DoF pose as supervisory signals. Note that such 3D optical flow shows robustness and accuracy to dynamic objects and textureless environments. In DeepVIO training, 2D optical flow network is constrained by the projection of its corresponding 3D optical flow, and LSTM-style IMU preintegration network and the fusion network are learned by minimizing the loss functions from ego-motion constraints. Furthermore, we employ an IMU status update scheme to improve IMU pose estimation through updating the additional gyroscope and accelerometer bias. The experimental results on KITTI and EuRoC datasets show that DeepVIO outperforms state-of-the-art learning based methods in terms of accuracy and data adaptability. Compared to the traditional methods, DeepVIO reduces the impacts of inaccurate Camera-IMU calibrations, unsynchronized and missing data. 

Title: Keep Doing What Worked: Behavioral Modelling Priors for Offline Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms promise to be applicable in settings where only a fixed data-set (batch) of environment interactions is available and no new experience can be acquired. This property makes these algorithms appealing for real world problems such as robot control. In practice, however, standard off-policy algorithms fail in the batch setting for continuous control. In this paper, we propose a simple solution to this problem. It admits the use of data generated by arbitrary behavior policies and uses a learned prior -- the advantage-weighted behavior model (ABM) -- to bias the RL policy towards actions that have previously been executed and are likely to be successful on the new task. Our method can be seen as an extension of recent work on batch-RL that enables stable learning from conflicting data-sources. We find improvements on competitive baselines in a variety of RL tasks -- including standard continuous control benchmarks and multi-task learning for simulated and real-world robots. 

Title: Autoregressive Policies for Continuous Control Deep Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Reinforcement learning algorithms rely on exploration to discover new behaviors, which is typically achieved by following a stochastic policy. In continuous control tasks, policies with a Gaussian distribution have been widely adopted. Gaussian exploration however does not result in smooth trajectories that generally correspond to safe and rewarding behaviors in practical tasks. In addition, Gaussian policies do not result in an effective exploration of an environment and become increasingly inefficient as the action rate increases. This contributes to a low sample efficiency often observed in learning continuous control tasks. We introduce a family of stationary autoregressive (AR) stochastic processes to facilitate exploration in continuous control domains. We show that proposed processes possess two desirable features: subsequent process observations are temporally coherent with continuously adjustable degree of coherence, and the process stationary distribution is standard normal. We derive an autoregressive policy (ARP) that implements such processes maintaining the standard agent-environment interface. We show how ARPs can be easily used with the existing off-the-shelf learning algorithms. Empirically we demonstrate that using ARPs results in improved exploration and sample efficiency in both simulated and real world domains, and, furthermore, provides smooth exploration trajectories that enable safe operation of robotic hardware. 

Title: Epipolar Geometry based Learning of Multi-view Depth and Ego-Motion from Monocular Sequences
Abstract:  Deep approaches to predict monocular depth and ego-motion have grown in recent years due to their ability to produce dense depth from monocular images. The main idea behind them is to optimize the photometric consistency over image sequences by warping one view into another, similar to direct visual odometry methods. One major drawback is that these methods infer depth from a single view, which might not effectively capture the relation between pixels. Moreover, simply minimizing the photometric loss does not ensure proper pixel correspondences, which is a key factor for accurate depth and pose estimations. In contrast, we propose a 2-view depth network to infer the scene depth from consecutive frames, thereby learning inter-pixel relationships. To ensure better correspondences, thereby better geometric understanding, we propose incorporating epipolar constraints to make the learning more geometrically sound. We use the Essential matrix obtained using Nist'er's Five Point Algorithm, to enforce meaningful geometric constraints, rather than using it as training labels. This allows us to use lesser no. of trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method results in better depth images and pose estimates, which capture the scene structure and motion in a better way. Such a geometrically constrained learning performs successfully even in cases where simply minimizing the photometric error would fail. 

Title: Exploiting Sparse Semantic HD Maps for Self-Driving Vehicle Localization
Abstract:  In this paper we propose a novel semantic localization algorithm that exploits multiple sensors and has precision on the order of a few centimeters. Our approach does not require detailed knowledge about the appearance of the world, and our maps require orders of magnitude less storage than maps utilized by traditional geometry- and LiDAR intensity-based localizers. This is important as self-driving cars need to operate in large environments. Towards this goal, we formulate the problem in a Bayesian filtering framework, and exploit lanes, traffic signs, as well as vehicle dynamics to localize robustly with respect to a sparse semantic map. We validate the effectiveness of our method on a new highway dataset consisting of 312km of roads. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is able to achieve 0.05m lateral accuracy and 1.12m longitudinal accuracy on average while taking up only 0.3% of the storage required by previous LiDAR intensity-based approaches. 

Title: Deep Tracking: Seeing Beyond Seeing Using Recurrent Neural Networks
Abstract:  This paper presents to the best of our knowledge the first end-to-end object tracking approach which directly maps from raw sensor input to object tracks in sensor space without requiring any feature engineering or system identification in the form of plant or sensor models. Specifically, our system accepts a stream of raw sensor data at one end and, in real-time, produces an estimate of the entire environment state at the output including even occluded objects. We achieve this by framing the problem as a deep learning task and exploit sequence models in the form of recurrent neural networks to learn a mapping from sensor measurements to object tracks. In particular, we propose a learning method based on a form of input dropout which allows learning in an unsupervised manner, only based on raw, occluded sensor data without access to ground-truth annotations. We demonstrate our approach using a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the task of tracking objects in 2D laser data -- as commonly encountered in robotics applications -- and show that it learns to track many dynamic objects despite occlusions and the presence of sensor noise. 

Title: Learning agile and dynamic motor skills for legged robots
Abstract:  Legged robots pose one of the greatest challenges in robotics. Dynamic and agile maneuvers of animals cannot be imitated by existing methods that are crafted by humans. A compelling alternative is reinforcement learning, which requires minimal craftsmanship and promotes the natural evolution of a control policy. However, so far, reinforcement learning research for legged robots is mainly limited to simulation, and only few and comparably simple examples have been deployed on real systems. The primary reason is that training with real robots, particularly with dynamically balancing systems, is complicated and expensive. In the present work, we introduce a method for training a neural network policy in simulation and transferring it to a state-of-the-art legged system, thereby leveraging fast, automated, and cost-effective data generation schemes. The approach is applied to the ANYmal robot, a sophisticated medium-dog-sized quadrupedal system. Using policies trained in simulation, the quadrupedal machine achieves locomotion skills that go beyond what had been achieved with prior methods: ANYmal is capable of precisely and energy-efficiently following high-level body velocity commands, running faster than before, and recovering from falling even in complex configurations. 

Title: Surface Type Classification for Autonomous Robot Indoor Navigation
Abstract:  In this work we describe the preparation of a time series dataset of inertial measurements for determining the surface type under a wheeled robot. The data consists of over 7600 labeled time series samples, with the corresponding surface type annotation. This data was used in two public competitions with over 1500 participant in total. Additionally, we describe the performance of state-of-art deep learning models for time series classification, as well as propose a baseline model based on an ensemble of machine learning methods. The baseline achieves an accuracy of over 68% with our nine-category dataset. 

Title: The EuroCity Persons Dataset: A Novel Benchmark for Object Detection
Abstract:  Big data has had a great share in the success of deep learning in computer vision. Recent works suggest that there is significant further potential to increase object detection performance by utilizing even bigger datasets. In this paper, we introduce the EuroCity Persons dataset, which provides a large number of highly diverse, accurate and detailed annotations of pedestrians, cyclists and other riders in urban traffic scenes. The images for this dataset were collected on-board a moving vehicle in 31 cities of 12 European countries. With over 238200 person instances manually labeled in over 47300 images, EuroCity Persons is nearly one order of magnitude larger than person datasets used previously for benchmarking. The dataset furthermore contains a large number of person orientation annotations (over 211200). We optimize four state-of-the-art deep learning approaches (Faster R-CNN, R-FCN, SSD and YOLOv3) to serve as baselines for the new object detection benchmark. In experiments with previous datasets we analyze the generalization capabilities of these detectors when trained with the new dataset. We furthermore study the effect of the training set size, the dataset diversity (day- vs. night-time, geographical region), the dataset detail (i.e. availability of object orientation information) and the annotation quality on the detector performance. Finally, we analyze error sources and discuss the road ahead. 

Title: Form2Fit: Learning Shape Priors for Generalizable Assembly from Disassembly
Abstract:  Is it possible to learn policies for robotic assembly that can generalize to new objects? We explore this idea in the context of the kit assembly task. Since classic methods rely heavily on object pose estimation, they often struggle to generalize to new objects without 3D CAD models or task-specific training data. In this work, we propose to formulate the kit assembly task as a shape matching problem, where the goal is to learn a shape descriptor that establishes geometric correspondences between object surfaces and their target placement locations from visual input. This formulation enables the model to acquire a broader understanding of how shapes and surfaces fit together for assembly -- allowing it to generalize to new objects and kits. To obtain training data for our model, we present a self-supervised data-collection pipeline that obtains ground truth object-to-placement correspondences by disassembling complete kits. Our resulting real-world system, Form2Fit, learns effective pick and place strategies for assembling objects into a variety of kits -- achieving $90\%$ average success rates under different initial conditions (e.g. varying object and kit poses), $94\%$ success under new configurations of multiple kits, and over $86\%$ success with completely new objects and kits. 

Title: Cognitive Interpretation of Everyday Activities: Toward Perceptual Narrative Based Visuo-Spatial Scene Interpretation
Abstract:  We position a narrative-centred computational model for high-level knowledge representation and reasoning in the context of a range of assistive technologies concerned with "visuo-spatial perception and cognition" tasks. Our proposed narrative model encompasses aspects such as \emph{space, events, actions, change, and interaction} from the viewpoint of commonsense reasoning and learning in large-scale cognitive systems. The broad focus of this paper is on the domain of "human-activity interpretation" in smart environments, ambient intelligence etc. In the backdrop of a "smart meeting cinematography" domain, we position the proposed narrative model, preliminary work on perceptual narrativisation, and the immediate outlook on constructing general-purpose open-source tools for perceptual narrativisation.

Title: Episodic Learning with Control Lyapunov Functions for Uncertain Robotic Systems
Abstract:  Many modern nonlinear control methods aim to endow systems with guaranteed properties, such as stability or safety, and have been successfully applied to the domain of robotics. However, model uncertainty remains a persistent challenge, weakening theoretical guarantees and causing implementation failures on physical systems. This paper develops a machine learning framework centered around Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) to adapt to parametric uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics in general robotic systems. Our proposed method proceeds by iteratively updating estimates of Lyapunov function derivatives and improving controllers, ultimately yielding a stabilizing quadratic program model-based controller. We validate our approach on a planar Segway simulation, demonstrating substantial performance improvements by iteratively refining on a base model-free controller. 

Title: LOL: Lidar-Only Odometry and Localization in 3D Point Cloud Maps
Abstract:  In this paper we deal with the problem of odometry and localization for Lidar-equipped vehicles driving in urban environments, where a premade target map exists to localize against. In our problem formulation, to correct the accumulated drift of the Lidar-only odometry we apply a place recognition method to detect geometrically similar locations between the online 3D point cloud and the a priori offline map. In the proposed system, we integrate a state-of-the-art Lidar-only odometry algorithm with a recently proposed 3D point segment matching method by complementing their advantages. Also, we propose additional enhancements in order to reduce the number of false matches between the online point cloud and the target map, and to refine the position estimation error whenever a good match is detected. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed LOL system on several Kitti datasets of different lengths and environments, where the relocalization accuracy and the precision of the vehicle's trajectory were significantly improved in every case, while still being able to maintain real-time performance. 

Title: Incorporating Human Domain Knowledge into Large Scale Cost Function Learning
Abstract:  Recent advances have shown the capability of Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCN) to model cost functions for motion planning in the context of learning driving preferences purely based on demonstration data from human drivers. While pure learning from demonstrations in the framework of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is a promising approach, we can benefit from well informed human priors and incorporate them into the learning process. Our work achieves this by pretraining a model to regress to a manual cost function and refining it based on Maximum Entropy Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning. When injecting prior knowledge as pretraining for the network, we achieve higher robustness, more visually distinct obstacle boundaries, and the ability to capture instances of obstacles that elude models that purely learn from demonstration data. Furthermore, by exploiting these human priors, the resulting model can more accurately handle corner cases that are scarcely seen in the demonstration data, such as stairs, slopes, and underpasses. 

Title: Locally Weighted Regression Pseudo-Rehearsal for Online Learning of Vehicle Dynamics
Abstract:  We consider the problem of online adaptation of a neural network designed to represent vehicle dynamics. The neural network model is intended to be used by an MPC control law to autonomously control the vehicle. This problem is challenging because both the input and target distributions are non-stationary, and naive approaches to online adaptation result in catastrophic forgetting, which can in turn lead to controller failures. We present a novel online learning method, which combines the pseudo-rehearsal method with locally weighted projection regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting Locally Weighted Projection Regression Pseudo-Rehearsal (LW-PR$^2$) method in simulation and on a large real world dataset collected with a 1/5 scale autonomous vehicle. 

Title: Semi-Dense 3D Reconstruction with a Stereo Event Camera
Abstract:  Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that offer several advantages, such as low latency, high-speed and high dynamic range, to tackle challenging scenarios in computer vision. This paper presents a solution to the problem of 3D reconstruction from data captured by a stereo event-camera rig moving in a static scene, such as in the context of stereo Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. The proposed method consists of the optimization of an energy function designed to exploit small-baseline spatio-temporal consistency of events triggered across both stereo image planes. To improve the density of the reconstruction and to reduce the uncertainty of the estimation, a probabilistic depth-fusion strategy is also developed. The resulting method has no special requirements on either the motion of the stereo event-camera rig or on prior knowledge about the scene. Experiments demonstrate our method can deal with both texture-rich scenes as well as sparse scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art stereo methods based on event data image representations. 

Title: A Simple Hierarchical Pooling Data Structure for Loop Closure
Abstract:  We propose a data structure obtained by hierarchically averaging bag-of-word descriptors during a sequence of views that achieves average speedups in large-scale loop closure applications ranging from 4 to 20 times on benchmark datasets. Although simple, the method works as well as sophisticated agglomerative schemes at a fraction of the cost with minimal loss of performance. 

Title: Automating Vehicles by Deep Reinforcement Learning using Task Separation with Hill Climbing
Abstract:  Within the context of autonomous driving a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed for the design of neural network-parameterized controllers. Classical model-based control methods, which include sampling- and lattice-based algorithms and model predictive control, suffer from the trade-off between model complexity and computational burden required for the online solution of expensive optimization or search problems at every short sampling time. To circumvent this trade-off, a 2-step procedure is motivated: first learning of a controller during offline training based on an arbitrarily complicated mathematical system model, before online fast feedforward evaluation of the trained controller. The contribution of this paper is the proposition of a simple gradient-free and model-based algorithm for deep reinforcement learning using task separation with hill climbing (TSHC). In particular, (i) simultaneous training on separate deterministic tasks with the purpose of encoding many motion primitives in a neural network, and (ii) the employment of maximally sparse rewards in combination with virtual velocity constraints (VVCs) in setpoint proximity are advocated. 

Title: Segway DRIVE Benchmark: Place Recognition and SLAM Data Collected by A Fleet of Delivery Robots
Abstract:  Visual place recognition and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have recently begun to be used in real-world autonomous navigation tasks like food delivery. Existing datasets for SLAM research are often not representative of in situ operations, leaving a gap between academic research and real-world deployment. In response, this paper presents the Segway DRIVE benchmark, a novel and challenging dataset suite collected by a fleet of Segway delivery robots. Each robot is equipped with a global-shutter fisheye camera, a consumer-grade IMU synced to the camera on chip, two low-cost wheel encoders, and a removable high-precision lidar for generating reference solutions. As they routinely carry out tasks in office buildings and shopping malls while collecting data, the dataset spanning a year is characterized by planar motions, moving pedestrians in scenes, and changing environment and lighting. Such factors typically pose severe challenges and may lead to failures for SLAM algorithms. Moreover, several metrics are proposed to evaluate metric place recognition algorithms. With these metrics, sample SLAM and metric place recognition methods were evaluated on this benchmark. The first release of our benchmark has hundreds of sequences, covering more than 50 km of indoor floors. More data will be added as the robot fleet continues to operate in real life. The benchmark is available at http://drive.segwayrobotics.com/#/dataset/download. 

Title: Learning Orientation Distributions for Object Pose Estimation
Abstract:  For robots to operate robustly in the real world, they should be aware of their uncertainty. However, most methods for object pose estimation return a single point estimate of the object's pose. In this work, we propose two learned methods for estimating a distribution over an object's orientation. Our methods take into account both the inaccuracies in the pose estimation as well as the object symmetries. Our first method, which regresses from deep learned features to an isotropic Bingham distribution, gives the best performance for orientation distribution estimation for non-symmetric objects. Our second method learns to compare deep features and generates a non-parameteric histogram distribution. This method gives the best performance on objects with unknown symmetries, accurately modeling both symmetric and non-symmetric objects, without any requirement of symmetry annotation. We show that both of these methods can be used to augment an existing pose estimator. Our evaluation compares our methods to a large number of baseline approaches for uncertainty estimation across a variety of different types of objects. 

Title: Self-Supervised Learning of State Estimation for Manipulating Deformable Linear Objects
Abstract:  We demonstrate model-based, visual robot manipulation of linear deformable objects. Our approach is based on a state-space representation of the physical system that the robot aims to control. This choice has multiple advantages, including the ease of incorporating physics priors in the dynamics model and perception model, and the ease of planning manipulation actions. In addition, physical states can naturally represent object instances of different appearances. Therefore, dynamics in the state space can be learned in one setting and directly used in other visually different settings. This is in contrast to dynamics learned in pixel space or latent space, where generalization to visual differences are not guaranteed. Challenges in taking the state-space approach are the estimation of the high-dimensional state of a deformable object from raw images, where annotations are very expensive on real data, and finding a dynamics model that is both accurate, generalizable, and efficient to compute. We are the first to demonstrate self-supervised training of rope state estimation on real images, without requiring expensive annotations. This is achieved by our novel self-supervising learning objective, which is generalizable across a wide range of visual appearances. With estimated rope states, we train a fast and differentiable neural network dynamics model that encodes the physics of mass-spring systems. Our method has a higher accuracy in predicting future states compared to models that do not involve explicit state estimation and do not use any physics prior, while only using 3\% of training data. We also show that our approach achieves more efficient manipulation, both in simulation and on a real robot, when used within a model predictive controller. 

Title: Structural-RNN: Deep Learning on Spatio-Temporal Graphs
Abstract:  Deep Recurrent Neural Network architectures, though remarkably capable at modeling sequences, lack an intuitive high-level spatio-temporal structure. That is while many problems in computer vision inherently have an underlying high-level structure and can benefit from it. Spatio-temporal graphs are a popular tool for imposing such high-level intuitions in the formulation of real world problems. In this paper, we propose an approach for combining the power of high-level spatio-temporal graphs and sequence learning success of Recurrent Neural Networks~(RNNs). We develop a scalable method for casting an arbitrary spatio-temporal graph as a rich RNN mixture that is feedforward, fully differentiable, and jointly trainable. The proposed method is generic and principled as it can be used for transforming any spatio-temporal graph through employing a certain set of well defined steps. The evaluations of the proposed approach on a diverse set of problems, ranging from modeling human motion to object interactions, shows improvement over the state-of-the-art with a large margin. We expect this method to empower new approaches to problem formulation through high-level spatio-temporal graphs and Recurrent Neural Networks. 

Title: Model-Based Offline Planning
Abstract:  Offline learning is a key part of making reinforcement learning (RL) useable in real systems. Offline RL looks at scenarios where there is data from a system's operation, but no direct access to the system when learning a policy. Recent work on training RL policies from offline data has shown results both with model-free policies learned directly from the data, or with planning on top of learnt models of the data. Model-free policies tend to be more performant, but are more opaque, harder to command externally, and less easy to integrate into larger systems. We propose an offline learner that generates a model that can be used to control the system directly through planning. This allows us to have easily controllable policies directly from data, without ever interacting with the system. We show the performance of our algorithm, Model-Based Offline Planning (MBOP) on a series of robotics-inspired tasks, and demonstrate its ability leverage planning to respect environmental constraints. We are able to find near-optimal polices for certain simulated systems from as little as 50 seconds of real-time system interaction, and create zero-shot goal-conditioned policies on a series of environments. 

Title: Pushbroom Stereo for High-Speed Navigation in Cluttered Environments
Abstract:  We present a novel stereo vision algorithm that is capable of obstacle detection on a mobile-CPU processor at 120 frames per second. Our system performs a subset of standard block-matching stereo processing, searching only for obstacles at a single depth. By using an onboard IMU and state-estimator, we can recover the position of obstacles at all other depths, building and updating a full depth-map at framerate. Here, we describe both the algorithm and our implementation on a high-speed, small UAV, flying at over 20 MPH (9 m/s) close to obstacles. The system requires no external sensing or computation and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first high-framerate stereo detection system running onboard a small UAV. 

Title: Relational Graph Learning for Crowd Navigation
Abstract:  We present a relational graph learning approach for robotic crowd navigation using model-based deep reinforcement learning that plans actions by looking into the future. Our approach reasons about the relations between all agents based on their latent features and uses a Graph Convolutional Network to encode higher-order interactions in each agent's state representation, which is subsequently leveraged for state prediction and value estimation. The ability to predict human motion allows us to perform multi-step lookahead planning, taking into account the temporal evolution of human crowds. We evaluate our approach against a state-of-the-art baseline for crowd navigation and ablations of our model to demonstrate that navigation with our approach is more efficient, results in fewer collisions, and avoids failure cases involving oscillatory and freezing behaviors. 

Title: On the Utility of Model Learning in HRI
Abstract:  Fundamental to robotics is the debate between model-based and model-free learning: should the robot build an explicit model of the world, or learn a policy directly? In the context of HRI, part of the world to be modeled is the human. One option is for the robot to treat the human as a black box and learn a policy for how they act directly. But it can also model the human as an agent, and rely on a "theory of mind" to guide or bias the learning (grey box). We contribute a characterization of the performance of these methods for an autonomous driving task under the optimistic case of having an ideal theory of mind, as well as under different scenarios in which the assumptions behind the robot's theory of mind for the human are wrong, as they inevitably will be in practice. 

Title: Localization for Ground Robots: On Manifold Representation, Integration, Re-Parameterization, and Optimization
Abstract:  In this paper, we focus on localizing ground robots, by probabilistically fusing measurements from the wheel odometry and a monocular camera. For ground robots, the wheel odometry is widely used in localization tasks, especially in applications under planar-scene based environments. However, since the wheel odometry only provides 2D motion estimates, it is extremely challenging to use that for performing accurate full 6D pose (3D position and 3D rotation) estimation. Traditional methods on 6D localization either approximate sensor or motion models, at a cost of accuracy reduction, or rely on other sensors, e.g., inertial measurement unit (IMU), to obtain full 6D motion. By contrast, in this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic framework that is able to use the wheel odometry measurements for high-precision 6D pose estimation, in which only the wheel odometry and a monocular camera are mandatory. Specifically, we propose novel methods for i) formulating a motion manifold by parametric representation, ii) performing manifold based 6D integration with the wheel odometry measurements, and iii) re-parameterizing manifold equations periodically for error reduction. Finally, we propose a complete localization algorithm based on a manifold-assisted sliding-window estimator, fusing measurements from the wheel odometry, a monocular camera, and optionally an IMU. By extensive simulated and real-world experiments, we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms a number of state-of-the-art vision based localization algorithms by a significant margin, especially when deployed in large-scale complicated environments. 

Title: Learning and Inferring Movement with Deep Generative Model
Abstract:  Learning and inference movement is a very challenging problem due to its high dimensionality and dependency to varied environments or tasks. In this paper, we propose an effective probabilistic method for learning and inference of basic movements. The motion planning problem is formulated as learning on a directed graphic model and deep generative model is used to perform learning and inference from demonstrations. An important characteristic of this method is that it flexibly incorporates the task descriptors and context information for long-term planning and it can be combined with dynamic systems for robot control. The experimental validations on robotic approaching path planning tasks show the advantages over the base methods with limited training data. 

Title: Improved Robustness and Safety for Autonomous Vehicle Control with Adversarial Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  To improve efficiency and reduce failures in autonomous vehicles, research has focused on developing robust and safe learning methods that take into account disturbances in the environment. Existing literature in robust reinforcement learning poses the learning problem as a two player game between the autonomous system and disturbances. This paper examines two different algorithms to solve the game, Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning and Neural Fictitious Self Play, and compares performance on an autonomous driving scenario. We extend the game formulation to a semi-competitive setting and demonstrate that the resulting adversary better captures meaningful disturbances that lead to better overall performance. The resulting robust policy exhibits improved driving efficiency while effectively reducing collision rates compared to baseline control policies produced by traditional reinforcement learning methods. 

Title: Adaptive Deep Learning through Visual Domain Localization
Abstract:  A commercial robot, trained by its manufacturer to recognize a predefined number and type of objects, might be used in many settings, that will in general differ in their illumination conditions, background, type and degree of clutter, and so on. Recent computer vision works tackle this generalization issue through domain adaptation methods, assuming as source the visual domain where the system is trained and as target the domain of deployment. All approaches assume to have access to images from all classes of the target during training, an unrealistic condition in robotics applications. We address this issue proposing an algorithm that takes into account the specific needs of robot vision. Our intuition is that the nature of the domain shift experienced mostly in robotics is local. We exploit this through the learning of maps that spatially ground the domain and quantify the degree of shift, embedded into an end-to-end deep domain adaptation architecture. By explicitly localizing the roots of the domain shift we significantly reduce the number of parameters of the architecture to tune, we gain the flexibility necessary to deal with subset of categories in the target domain at training time, and we provide a clear feedback on the rationale behind any classification decision, which can be exploited in human-robot interactions. Experiments on two different settings of the iCub World database confirm the suitability of our method for robot vision. 

Title: Meta-Learning via Learned Loss
Abstract:  Typically, loss functions, regularization mechanisms and other important aspects of training parametric models are chosen heuristically from a limited set of options. In this paper, we take the first step towards automating this process, with the view of producing models which train faster and more robustly. Concretely, we present a meta-learning method for learning parametric loss functions that can generalize across different tasks and model architectures. We develop a pipeline for meta-training such loss functions, targeted at maximizing the performance of the model trained under them. The loss landscape produced by our learned losses significantly improves upon the original task-specific losses in both supervised and reinforcement learning tasks. Furthermore, we show that our meta-learning framework is flexible enough to incorporate additional information at meta-train time. This information shapes the learned loss function such that the environment does not need to provide this information during meta-test time. 

Title: Assessing Transferability from Simulation to Reality for Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Learning robot control policies from physics simulations is of great interest to the robotics community as it may render the learning process faster, cheaper, and safer by alleviating the need for expensive real-world experiments. However, the direct transfer of learned behavior from simulation to reality is a major challenge. Optimizing a policy on a slightly faulty simulator can easily lead to the maximization of the `Simulation Optimization Bias` (SOB). In this case, the optimizer exploits modeling errors of the simulator such that the resulting behavior can potentially damage the robot. We tackle this challenge by applying domain randomization, i.e., randomizing the parameters of the physics simulations during learning. We propose an algorithm called Simulation-based Policy Optimization with Transferability Assessment (SPOTA) which uses an estimator of the SOB to formulate a stopping criterion for training. The introduced estimator quantifies the over-fitting to the set of domains experienced while training. Our experimental results on two different second order nonlinear systems show that the new simulation-based policy search algorithm is able to learn a control policy exclusively from a randomized simulator, which can be applied directly to real systems without any additional training. 

Title: BiTraP: Bi-directional Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction with Multi-modal Goal Estimation
Abstract:  Pedestrian trajectory prediction is an essential task in robotic applications such as autonomous driving and robot navigation. State-of-the-art trajectory predictors use a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to encode observed trajectories and decode multi-modal future trajectories. This process can suffer from accumulated errors over long prediction horizons (>=2 seconds). This paper presents BiTraP, a goal-conditioned bi-directional multi-modal trajectory prediction method based on the CVAE. BiTraP estimates the goal (end-point) of trajectories and introduces a novel bi-directional decoder to improve longer-term trajectory prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show that BiTraP generalizes to both first-person view (FPV) and bird's-eye view (BEV) scenarios and outperforms state-of-the-art results by ~10-50%. We also show that different choices of non-parametric versus parametric target models in the CVAE directly influence the predicted multi-modal trajectory distributions. These results provide guidance on trajectory predictor design for robotic applications such as collision avoidance and navigation systems. 

Title: From Seeing to Moving: A Survey on Learning for Visual Indoor Navigation (VIN)
Abstract:  Visual Indoor Navigation (VIN) task has drawn increasing attentions from the data-driven machine learning communities especially with the recent reported success from learning-based methods. Due to the innate complexity of this task, researchers have tried approaching the problem from a variety of different angles, the full scope of which has not yet been captured within an overarching report. In this survey, we discuss the representative work of learning-based approaches for visual navigation and its related tasks. Firstly, we summarize the current work in terms of task representations and applied methods along with their properties. We then further identify and discuss lingering issues impeding the performance of VIN tasks and motivate future research in these key areas worth exploring in the future for the community. 

Title: Neural Network Dynamics for Model-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning with Model-Free Fine-Tuning
Abstract:  Model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been shown to be capable of learning a wide range of robotic skills, but typically require a very large number of samples to achieve good performance. Model-based algorithms, in principle, can provide for much more efficient learning, but have proven difficult to extend to expressive, high-capacity models such as deep neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that medium-sized neural network models can in fact be combined with model predictive control (MPC) to achieve excellent sample complexity in a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, producing stable and plausible gaits to accomplish various complex locomotion tasks. We also propose using deep neural network dynamics models to initialize a model-free learner, in order to combine the sample efficiency of model-based approaches with the high task-specific performance of model-free methods. We empirically demonstrate on MuJoCo locomotion tasks that our pure model-based approach trained on just random action data can follow arbitrary trajectories with excellent sample efficiency, and that our hybrid algorithm can accelerate model-free learning on high-speed benchmark tasks, achieving sample efficiency gains of 3-5x on swimmer, cheetah, hopper, and ant agents.

Title: A General Framework for Flexible Multi-Cue Photometric Point Cloud Registration
Abstract:  The ability to build maps is a key functionality for the majority of mobile robots. A central ingredient to most mapping systems is the registration or alignment of the recorded sensor data. In this paper, we present a general methodology for photometric registration that can deal with multiple different cues. We provide examples for registering RGBD as well as 3D LIDAR data. In contrast to popular point cloud registration approaches such as ICP our method does not rely on explicit data association and exploits multiple modalities such as raw range and image data streams. Color, depth, and normal information are handled in an uniform manner and the registration is obtained by minimizing the pixel-wise difference between two multi-channel images. We developed a flexible and general framework and implemented our approach inside that framework. We also released our implementation as open source C++ code. The experiments show that our approach allows for an accurate registration of the sensor data without requiring an explicit data association or model-specific adaptations to datasets or sensors. Our approach exploits the different cues in a natural and consistent way and the registration can be done at framerate for a typical range or imaging sensor. 

Title: Extending Maps with Semantic and Contextual Object Information for Robot Navigation: a Learning-Based Framework using Visual and Depth Cues
Abstract:  This paper addresses the problem of building augmented metric representations of scenes with semantic information from RGB-D images. We propose a complete framework to create an enhanced map representation of the environment with object-level information to be used in several applications such as human-robot interaction, assistive robotics, visual navigation, or in manipulation tasks. Our formulation leverages a CNN-based object detector (Yolo) with a 3D model-based segmentation technique to perform instance semantic segmentation, and to localize, identify, and track different classes of objects in the scene. The tracking and positioning of semantic classes is done with a dictionary of Kalman filters in order to combine sensor measurements over time and then providing more accurate maps. The formulation is designed to identify and to disregard dynamic objects in order to obtain a medium-term invariant map representation. The proposed method was evaluated with collected and publicly available RGB-D data sequences acquired in different indoor scenes. Experimental results show the potential of the technique to produce augmented semantic maps containing several objects (notably doors). We also provide to the community a dataset composed of annotated object classes (doors, fire extinguishers, benches, water fountains) and their positioning, as well as the source code as ROS packages. 

Title: BaRC: Backward Reachability Curriculum for Robotic Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an attractive approach to learn control policies for high-dimensional systems, but its relatively poor sample complexity often forces training in simulated environments. Even in simulation, goal-directed tasks whose natural reward function is sparse remain intractable for state-of-the-art model-free algorithms for continuous control. The bottleneck in these tasks is the prohibitive amount of exploration required to obtain a learning signal from the initial state of the system. In this work, we leverage physical priors in the form of an approximate system dynamics model to design a curriculum scheme for a model-free policy optimization algorithm. Our Backward Reachability Curriculum (BaRC) begins policy training from states that require a small number of actions to accomplish the task, and expands the initial state distribution backwards in a dynamically-consistent manner once the policy optimization algorithm demonstrates sufficient performance. BaRC is general, in that it can accelerate training of any model-free RL algorithm on a broad class of goal-directed continuous control MDPs. Its curriculum strategy is physically intuitive, easy-to-tune, and allows incorporating physical priors to accelerate training without hindering the performance, flexibility, and applicability of the model-free RL algorithm. We evaluate our approach on two representative dynamic robotic learning problems and find substantial performance improvement relative to previous curriculum generation techniques and naive exploration strategies. 

Title: Using Local Experiences for Global Motion Planning
Abstract:  Sampling-based planners are effective in many real-world applications such as robotics manipulation, navigation, and even protein modeling. However, it is often challenging to generate a collision-free path in environments where key areas are hard to sample. In the absence of any prior information, sampling-based planners are forced to explore uniformly or heuristically, which can lead to degraded performance. One way to improve performance is to use prior knowledge of environments to adapt the sampling strategy to the problem at hand. In this work, we decompose the workspace into local primitives, memorizing local experiences by these primitives in the form of local samplers, and store them in a database. We synthesize an efficient global sampler by retrieving local experiences relevant to the given situation. Our method transfers knowledge effectively between diverse environments that share local primitives and speeds up the performance dramatically. Our results show, in terms of solution time, an improvement of multiple orders of magnitude in two traditionally challenging high-dimensional problems compared to state-of-the-art approaches. 

Title: Complete Endomorphisms in Computer Vision
Abstract:  Correspondences between k-tuples of points are key in multiple view geometry and motion analysis. Regular transformations are posed by homographies between two projective planes that serves as structural models for images. Such transformations can not include degenerate situations. Fundamental or essential matrices expand homographies with structural information by using degenerate bilinear maps. The projectivization of the endomorphisms of a three-dimensional vector space includes all of them. Hence, they are able to explain a wider range of eventually degenerate transformations between arbitrary pairs of views. To include these degenerate situations, this paper introduces a completion of bilinear maps between spaces given by an equivariant compactification of regular transformations. This completion is extensible to the varieties of fundamental and essential matrices, where most methods based on regular transformations fail. The construction of complete endomorphisms manages degenerate projection maps using a simultaneous action on source and target spaces. In such way, this mathematical construction provides a robust framework to relate corresponding views in multiple view geometry. 

Title: Deep Tracking on the Move: Learning to Track the World from a Moving Vehicle using Recurrent Neural Networks
Abstract:  This paper presents an end-to-end approach for tracking static and dynamic objects for an autonomous vehicle driving through crowded urban environments. Unlike traditional approaches to tracking, this method is learned end-to-end, and is able to directly predict a full unoccluded occupancy grid map from raw laser input data. Inspired by the recently presented DeepTracking approach [Ondruska, 2016], we employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the temporal evolution of the state of the environment, and propose to use Spatial Transformer modules to exploit estimates of the egomotion of the vehicle. Our results demonstrate the ability to track a range of objects, including cars, buses, pedestrians, and cyclists through occlusion, from both moving and stationary platforms, using a single learned model. Experimental results demonstrate that the model can also predict the future states of objects from current inputs, with greater accuracy than previous work. 

Title: Autonomous, Monocular, Vision-Based Snake Robot Navigation and Traversal of Cluttered Environments using Rectilinear Gait Motion
Abstract:  Rectilinear forms of snake-like robotic locomotion are anticipated to be an advantage in obstacle-strewn scenarios characterizing urban disaster zones, subterranean collapses, and other natural environments. The elongated, laterally-narrow footprint associated with these motion strategies is well-suited to traversal of confined spaces and narrow pathways. Navigation and path planning in the absence of global sensing, however, remains a pivotal challenge to be addressed prior to practical deployment of these robotic mechanisms. Several challenges related to visual processing and localization need to be resolved to to enable navigation. As a first pass in this direction, we equip a wireless, monocular color camera to the head of a robotic snake. Visiual odometry and mapping from ORB-SLAM permits self-localization in planar, obstacle-strewn environments. Ground plane traversability segmentation in conjunction with perception-space collision detection permits path planning for navigation. A previously presented dynamical reduction of rectilinear snake locomotion to a non-holonomic kinematic vehicle informs both SLAM and planning. The simplified motion model is then applied to track planned trajectories through an obstacle configuration. This navigational framework enables a snake-like robotic platform to autonomously navigate and traverse unknown scenarios with only monocular vision. 

Title: Real-Time Object Detection and Recognition on Low-Compute Humanoid Robots using Deep Learning
Abstract:  We envision that in the near future, humanoid robots would share home space and assist us in our daily and routine activities through object manipulations. One of the fundamental technologies that need to be developed for robots is to enable them to detect objects and recognize them for effective manipulations and take real-time decisions involving those objects. In this paper, we describe a novel architecture that enables multiple low-compute NAO robots to perform real-time detection, recognition and localization of objects in its camera view and take programmable actions based on the detected objects. The proposed algorithm for object detection and localization is an empirical modification of YOLOv3, based on indoor experiments in multiple scenarios, with a smaller weight size and lesser computational requirements. Quantization of the weights and re-adjusting filter sizes and layer arrangements for convolutions improved the inference time for low-resolution images from the robot s camera feed. YOLOv3 was chosen after a comparative study of bounding box algorithms was performed with an objective to choose one that strikes the perfect balance among information retention, low inference time and high accuracy for real-time object detection and localization. The architecture also comprises of an effective end-to-end pipeline to feed the real-time frames from the camera feed to the neural net and use its results for guiding the robot with customizable actions corresponding to the detected class labels. 

Title: How Robust is 3D Human Pose Estimation to Occlusion?
Abstract:  Occlusion is commonplace in realistic human-robot shared environments, yet its effects are not considered in standard 3D human pose estimation benchmarks. This leaves the question open: how robust are state-of-the-art 3D pose estimation methods against partial occlusions? We study several types of synthetic occlusions over the Human3.6M dataset and find a method with state-of-the-art benchmark performance to be sensitive even to low amounts of occlusion. Addressing this issue is key to progress in applications such as collaborative and service robotics. We take a first step in this direction by improving occlusion-robustness through training data augmentation with synthetic occlusions. This also turns out to be an effective regularizer that is beneficial even for non-occluded test cases. 

Title: Learning Agile Robotic Locomotion Skills by Imitating Animals
Abstract:  Reproducing the diverse and agile locomotion skills of animals has been a longstanding challenge in robotics. While manually-designed controllers have been able to emulate many complex behaviors, building such controllers involves a time-consuming and difficult development process, often requiring substantial expertise of the nuances of each skill. Reinforcement learning provides an appealing alternative for automating the manual effort involved in the development of controllers. However, designing learning objectives that elicit the desired behaviors from an agent can also require a great deal of skill-specific expertise. In this work, we present an imitation learning system that enables legged robots to learn agile locomotion skills by imitating real-world animals. We show that by leveraging reference motion data, a single learning-based approach is able to automatically synthesize controllers for a diverse repertoire behaviors for legged robots. By incorporating sample efficient domain adaptation techniques into the training process, our system is able to learn adaptive policies in simulation that can then be quickly adapted for real-world deployment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we train an 18-DoF quadruped robot to perform a variety of agile behaviors ranging from different locomotion gaits to dynamic hops and turns. 

Title: Reinforcement Learning for UAV Autonomous Navigation, Mapping and Target Detection
Abstract:  In this paper, we study a joint detection, mapping and navigation problem for a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a low complexity radar and flying in an unknown environment. The goal is to optimize its trajectory with the purpose of maximizing the mapping accuracy and, at the same time, to avoid areas where measurements might not be sufficiently informative from the perspective of a target detection. This problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the UAV is an agent that runs either a state estimator for target detection and for environment mapping, and a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to infer its own policy of navigation (i.e., the control law). Numerical results show the feasibility of the proposed idea, highlighting the UAV's capability of autonomously exploring areas with high probability of target detection while reconstructing the surrounding environment. 

Title: Cloud-Based Autonomous Indoor Navigation: A Case Study
Abstract:  In this case study, we design, integrate and implement a cloud-enabled autonomous robotic navigation system. The system has the following features: map generation and robot coordination via cloud service and video streaming to allow online monitoring and control in case of emergency. The system has been tested to generate a map for a long corridor using two modes: manual and autonomous. The autonomous mode has shown more accurate map. In addition, the field experiments confirm the benefit of offloading the heavy computation to the cloud by significantly shortening the time required to build the map. 

Title: Control Design of Autonomous Drone Using Deep Learning Based Image Understanding Techniques
Abstract:  This paper presents a new framework to use images as the inputs for the controller to have autonomous flight, considering the noisy indoor environment and uncertainties. A new Proportional-Integral-Derivative-Accelerated (PIDA) control with a derivative filter is proposed to improves drone/quadcopter flight stability within a noisy environment and enables autonomous flight using object and depth detection techniques. The mathematical model is derived from an accurate model with a high level of fidelity by addressing the problems of non-linearity, uncertainties, and coupling. The proposed PIDA controller is tuned by Stochastic Dual Simplex Algorithm (SDSA) to support autonomous flight. The simulation results show that adapting the deep learning-based image understanding techniques (RetinaNet ant colony detection and PSMNet) to the proposed controller can enable the generation and tracking of the desired point in the presence of environmental disturbances. 

Title: Policy Transfer with Strategy Optimization
Abstract:  Computer simulation provides an automatic and safe way for training robotic control policies to achieve complex tasks such as locomotion. However, a policy trained in simulation usually does not transfer directly to the real hardware due to the differences between the two environments. Transfer learning using domain randomization is a promising approach, but it usually assumes that the target environment is close to the distribution of the training environments, thus relying heavily on accurate system identification. In this paper, we present a different approach that leverages domain randomization for transferring control policies to unknown environments. The key idea that, instead of learning a single policy in the simulation, we simultaneously learn a family of policies that exhibit different behaviors. When tested in the target environment, we directly search for the best policy in the family based on the task performance, without the need to identify the dynamic parameters. We evaluate our method on five simulated robotic control problems with different discrepancies in the training and testing environment and demonstrate that our method can overcome larger modeling errors compared to training a robust policy or an adaptive policy. 

Title: Learning to Walk in the Real World with Minimal Human Effort
Abstract:  Reliable and stable locomotion has been one of the most fundamental challenges for legged robots. Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has emerged as a promising method for developing such control policies autonomously. In this paper, we develop a system for learning legged locomotion policies with deep RL in the real world with minimal human effort. The key difficulties for on-robot learning systems are automatic data collection and safety. We overcome these two challenges by developing a multi-task learning procedure, an automatic reset controller, and a safety-constrained RL framework. We tested our system on the task of learning to walk on three different terrains: flat ground, a soft mattress, and a doormat with crevices. Our system can automatically and efficiently learn locomotion skills on a Minitaur robot with little human intervention. 

Title: Learning Kinematic Descriptions using SPARE: Simulated and Physical ARticulated Extendable dataset
Abstract:  Next generation robots will need to understand intricate and articulated objects as they cooperate in human environments. To do so, these robots will need to move beyond their current abilities--- working with relatively simple objects in a task-indifferent manner--- toward more sophisticated abilities that dynamically estimate the properties of complex, articulated objects. To that end, we make two compelling contributions toward general articulated (physical) object understanding in this paper. First, we introduce a new dataset, SPARE: Simulated and Physical ARticulated Extendable dataset. SPARE is an extendable open-source dataset providing equivalent simulated and physical instances of articulated objects (kinematic chains), providing the greater research community with a training and evaluation tool for methods generating kinematic descriptions of articulated objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first joint visual and physical (3D-printable) dataset for the Vision community. Second, we present a deep neural network that can predit the number of links and the length of the links of an articulated object. These new ideas outperform classical approaches to understanding kinematic chains, such tracking-based methods, which fail in the case of occlusion and do not leverage multiple views when available. 

Title: A Generalizable Knowledge Framework for Semantic Indoor Mapping Based on Markov Logic Networks and Data Driven MCMC
Abstract:  In this paper, we propose a generalizable knowledge framework for data abstraction, i.e. finding compact abstract model for input data using predefined abstract terms. Based on these abstract terms, intelligent autonomous systems, such as a robot, should be able to make inference according to specific knowledge base, so that they can better handle the complexity and uncertainty of the real world. We propose to realize this framework by combining Markov logic networks (MLNs) and data driven MCMC sampling, because the former are a powerful tool for modelling uncertain knowledge and the latter provides an efficient way to draw samples from unknown complex distributions. Furthermore, we show in detail how to adapt this framework to a certain task, in particular, semantic robot mapping. Based on MLNs, we formulate task-specific context knowledge as descriptive soft rules. Experiments on real world data and simulated data confirm the usefulness of our framework. 

Title: Model-Reference Reinforcement Learning Control of Autonomous Surface Vehicles with Uncertainties
Abstract:  This paper presents a novel model-reference reinforcement learning control method for uncertain autonomous surface vehicles. The proposed control combines a conventional control method with deep reinforcement learning. With the conventional control, we can ensure the learning-based control law provides closed-loop stability for the overall system, and potentially increase the sample efficiency of the deep reinforcement learning. With the reinforcement learning, we can directly learn a control law to compensate for modeling uncertainties. In the proposed control, a nominal system is employed for the design of a baseline control law using a conventional control approach. The nominal system also defines the desired performance for uncertain autonomous vehicles to follow. In comparison with traditional deep reinforcement learning methods, our proposed learning-based control can provide stability guarantees and better sample efficiency. We demonstrate the performance of the new algorithm via extensive simulation results. 

Title: Robot Object Retrieval with Contextual Natural Language Queries
Abstract:  Natural language object retrieval is a highly useful yet challenging task for robots in human-centric environments. Previous work has primarily focused on commands specifying the desired object's type such as "scissors" and/or visual attributes such as "red," thus limiting the robot to only known object classes. We develop a model to retrieve objects based on descriptions of their usage. The model takes in a language command containing a verb, for example "Hand me something to cut," and RGB images of candidate objects and selects the object that best satisfies the task specified by the verb. Our model directly predicts an object's appearance from the object's use specified by a verb phrase. We do not need to explicitly specify an object's class label. Our approach allows us to predict high level concepts like an object's utility based on the language query. Based on contextual information present in the language commands, our model can generalize to unseen object classes and unknown nouns in the commands. Our model correctly selects objects out of sets of five candidates to fulfill natural language commands, and achieves an average accuracy of 62.3% on a held-out test set of unseen ImageNet object classes and 53.0% on unseen object classes and unknown nouns. Our model also achieves an average accuracy of 54.7% on unseen YCB object classes, which have a different image distribution from ImageNet objects. We demonstrate our model on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot arm, enabling the robot to retrieve objects based on natural language descriptions of their usage. We also present a new dataset of 655 verb-object pairs denoting object usage over 50 verbs and 216 object classes. 

Title: Differential Methods in Catadioptric Sensor Design with Applications to Panoramic Imaging
Abstract:  We discuss design techniques for catadioptric sensors that realize given projections. In general, these problems do not have solutions, but approximate solutions may often be found that are visually acceptable. There are several methods to approach this problem, but here we focus on what we call the ``vector field approach''. An application is given where a true panoramic mirror is derived, i.e. a mirror that yields a cylindrical projection to the viewer without any digital unwarping. 

Title: Efficient Derivative Computation for Cumulative B-Splines on Lie Groups
Abstract:  Continuous-time trajectory representation has recently gained popularity for tasks where the fusion of high-frame-rate sensors and multiple unsynchronized devices is required. Lie group cumulative B-splines are a popular way of representing continuous trajectories without singularities. They have been used in near real-time SLAM and odometry systems with IMU, LiDAR, regular, RGB-D and event cameras, as well as for offline calibration. These applications require efficient computation of time derivatives (velocity, acceleration), but all prior works rely on a computationally suboptimal formulation. In this work we present an alternative derivation of time derivatives based on recurrence relations that needs $\mathcal{O}(k)$ instead of $\mathcal{O}(k^2)$ matrix operations (for a spline of order $k$) and results in simple and elegant expressions. While producing the same result, the proposed approach significantly speeds up the trajectory optimization and allows for computing simple analytic derivatives with respect to spline knots. The results presented in this paper pave the way for incorporating continuous-time trajectory representations into more applications where real-time performance is required. 

Title: Cooperation-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Merging in Dense Traffic
Abstract:  Decision making in dense traffic can be challenging for autonomous vehicles. An autonomous system only relying on predefined road priorities and considering other drivers as moving objects will cause the vehicle to freeze and fail the maneuver. Human drivers leverage the cooperation of other drivers to avoid such deadlock situations and convince others to change their behavior. Decision making algorithms must reason about the interaction with other drivers and anticipate a broad range of driver behaviors. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning approach to learn how to interact with drivers with different cooperation levels. We enhanced the performance of traditional reinforcement learning algorithms by maintaining a belief over the level of cooperation of other drivers. We show that our agent successfully learns how to navigate a dense merging scenario with less deadlocks than with online planning methods. 

Title: Survey on Various Gesture Recognition Techniques for Interfacing Machines Based on Ambient Intelligence
Abstract:  Gesture recognition is mainly apprehensive on analyzing the functionality of human wits. The main goal of gesture recognition is to create a system which can recognize specific human gestures and use them to convey information or for device control. Hand gestures provide a separate complementary modality to speech for expressing ones ideas. Information associated with hand gestures in a conversation is degree,discourse structure, spatial and temporal structure. The approaches present can be mainly divided into Data-Glove Based and Vision Based approaches. An important face feature point is the nose tip. Since nose is the highest protruding point from the face. Besides that, it is not affected by facial expressions.Another important function of the nose is that it is able to indicate the head pose. Knowledge of the nose location will enable us to align an unknown 3D face with those in a face database. Eye detection is divided into eye position detection and eye contour detection. Existing works in eye detection can be classified into two major categories: traditional image-based passive approaches and the active IR based approaches. The former uses intensity and shape of eyes for detection and the latter works on the assumption that eyes have a reflection under near IR illumination and produce bright/dark pupil effect. The traditional methods can be broadly classified into three categories: template based methods,appearance based methods and feature based methods. The purpose of this paper is to compare various human Gesture recognition systems for interfacing machines directly to human wits without any corporeal media in an ambient environment. 

Title: Deep Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Object Disentangling
Abstract:  Deep learning in combination with improved training techniques and high computational power has led to recent advances in the field of reinforcement learning (RL) and to successful robotic RL applications such as in-hand manipulation. However, most robotic RL relies on a well known initial state distribution. In real-world tasks, this information is however often not available. For example, when disentangling waste objects the actual position of the robot w.r.t.\ the objects may not match the positions the RL policy was trained for. To solve this problem, we present a novel adversarial reinforcement learning (ARL) framework. The ARL framework utilizes an adversary, which is trained to steer the original agent, the protagonist, to challenging states. We train the protagonist and the adversary jointly to allow them to adapt to the changing policy of their opponent. We show that our method can generalize from training to test scenarios by training an end-to-end system for robot control to solve a challenging object disentangling task. Experiments with a KUKA LBR+ 7-DOF robot arm show that our approach outperforms the baseline method in disentangling when starting from different initial states than provided during training. 

Title: A new design of a flying robot, with advanced computer vision techniques to perform self-maintenance of smart grids
Abstract:  In this paper, we present a full design of a flying robot to investigate the state of power grid components and to perform the appropriate maintenance procedures according to each fail or defect that could be recognized. To realize this purpose; different types of sensors including thermal and aerial vision-based systems are employed in this design. The main features and technical specifications of this robot are presented and discussed here in detail. Some essential and advanced computer vision techniques are exploited in this work to take some readings and measurements from the robot's surroundings. From each given image, many sub-images containing different electrical components are extracted using a new region proposal approach that relies on Discrete Wavelet Transform, to be classified later by utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network. 

Title: A Motion Taxonomy for Manipulation Embedding
Abstract:  To represent motions from a mechanical point of view, this paper explores motion embedding using the motion taxonomy. With this taxonomy, manipulations can be described and represented as binary strings called motion codes. Motion codes capture mechanical properties, such as contact type and trajectory, that should be used to define suitable distance metrics between motions or loss functions for deep learning and reinforcement learning. Motion codes can also be used to consolidate aliases or cluster motion types that share similar properties. Using existing data sets as a reference, we discuss how motion codes can be created and assigned to actions that are commonly seen in activities of daily living based on intuition as well as real data. Motion codes are compared to vectors from pre-trained Word2Vec models, and we show that motion codes maintain distances that closely match the reality of manipulation. 

Title: Neural Contraction Metrics for Robust Estimation and Control: A Convex Optimization Approach
Abstract:  This paper presents a new deep learning-based framework for robust nonlinear estimation and control using the concept of a Neural Contraction Metric (NCM). The NCM uses a deep long short-term memory recurrent neural network for a global approximation of an optimal contraction metric, the existence of which is a necessary and sufficient condition for exponential stability of nonlinear systems. The optimality stems from the fact that the contraction metrics sampled offline are the solutions of a convex optimization problem to minimize an upper bound of the steady-state Euclidean distance between perturbed and unperturbed system trajectories. We demonstrate how to exploit NCMs to design an online optimal estimator and controller for nonlinear systems with bounded disturbances utilizing their duality. The performance of our framework is illustrated through Lorenz oscillator state estimation and spacecraft optimal motion planning problems. 

Title: Variable Impedance Control in End-Effector Space: An Action Space for Reinforcement Learning in Contact-Rich Tasks
Abstract:  Reinforcement Learning (RL) of contact-rich manipulation tasks has yielded impressive results in recent years. While many studies in RL focus on varying the observation space or reward model, few efforts focused on the choice of action space (e.g. joint or end-effector space, position, velocity, etc.). However, studies in robot motion control indicate that choosing an action space that conforms to the characteristics of the task can simplify exploration and improve robustness to disturbances. This paper studies the effect of different action spaces in deep RL and advocates for Variable Impedance Control in End-effector Space (VICES) as an advantageous action space for constrained and contact-rich tasks. We evaluate multiple action spaces on three prototypical manipulation tasks: Path Following (task with no contact), Door Opening (task with kinematic constraints), and Surface Wiping (task with continuous contact). We show that VICES improves sample efficiency, maintains low energy consumption, and ensures safety across all three experimental setups. Further, RL policies learned with VICES can transfer across different robot models in simulation, and from simulation to real for the same robot.

Title: Towards Real-Time Advancement of Underwater Visual Quality with GAN
Abstract:  Low visual quality has prevented underwater robotic vision from a wide range of applications. Although several algorithms have been developed, real-time and adaptive methods are deficient for real-world tasks. In this paper, we address this difficulty based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), and propose a GAN-based restoration scheme (GAN-RS). In particular, we develop a multi-branch discriminator including an adversarial branch and a critic branch for the purpose of simultaneously preserving image content and removing underwater noise. In addition to adversarial learning, a novel dark channel prior loss also promotes the generator to produce realistic vision. More specifically, an underwater index is investigated to describe underwater properties, and a loss function based on the underwater index is designed to train the critic branch for underwater noise suppression. Through extensive comparisons on visual quality and feature restoration, we confirm the superiority of the proposed approach. Consequently, the GAN-RS can adaptively improve underwater visual quality in real time and induce an overall superior restoration performance. Finally, a real-world experiment is conducted on the seabed for grasping marine products, and the results are quite promising. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/SeanChenxy/GAN_RS. 

Title: Event-based Vision meets Deep Learning on Steering Prediction for Self-driving Cars
Abstract:  Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that naturally capture the dynamics of a scene, filtering out redundant information. This paper presents a deep neural network approach that unlocks the potential of event cameras on a challenging motion-estimation task: prediction of a vehicle's steering angle. To make the best out of this sensor-algorithm combination, we adapt state-of-the-art convolutional architectures to the output of event sensors and extensively evaluate the performance of our approach on a publicly available large scale event-camera dataset (~1000 km). We present qualitative and quantitative explanations of why event cameras allow robust steering prediction even in cases where traditional cameras fail, e.g. challenging illumination conditions and fast motion. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of leveraging transfer learning from traditional to event-based vision, and show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms based on standard cameras. 

Title: A Single RGB Camera Based Gait Analysis with a Mobile Tele-Robot for Healthcare
Abstract:  With the increasing awareness of high-quality life, there is a growing need for health monitoring devices running robust algorithms in home environment. Health monitoring technologies enable real-time analysis of users' health status, offering long-term healthcare support and reducing hospitalization time. The purpose of this work is twofold, the software focuses on the analysis of gait, which is widely adopted for joint correction and assessing any lower limb or spinal problem. On the hardware side, we design a novel marker-less gait analysis device using a low-cost RGB camera mounted on a mobile tele-robot. As gait analysis with a single camera is much more challenging compared to previous works utilizing multi-cameras, a RGB-D camera or wearable sensors, we propose using vision-based human pose estimation approaches. More specifically, based on the output of two state-of-the-art human pose estimation models (Openpose and VNect), we devise measurements for four bespoke gait parameters: inversion/eversion, dorsiflexion/plantarflexion, ankle and foot progression angles. We thereby classify walking patterns into normal, supination, pronation and limp. We also illustrate how to run the purposed machine learning models in low-resource environments such as a single entry-level CPU. Experiments show that our single RGB camera method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods based on depth cameras or multi-camera motion capture system, at smaller hardware costs. 

Title: Adversarial Curiosity
Abstract:  Model-based curiosity combines active learning approaches to optimal sampling with the information gain based incentives for exploration presented in the curiosity literature. Existing model-based curiosity methods look to approximate prediction uncertainty with approaches which struggle to scale to many prediction-planning pipelines used in robotics tasks. We address these scalability issues with an adversarial curiosity method minimizing a score given by a discriminator network. This discriminator is optimized jointly with a prediction model and enables our active learning approach to sample sequences of observations and actions which result in predictions considered the least realistic by the discriminator. We demonstrate increased downstream task performance in simulated environments using our adversarial curiosity approach compared to other model-based and model-free exploration strategies. We further demonstrate the ability of our adversarial curiosity method to scale to a robotic manipulation prediction-planning pipeline where we improve sample efficiency and prediction performance for a domain transfer problem. 

Title: Learning to Optimally Segment Point Clouds
Abstract:  We focus on the problem of class-agnostic instance segmentation of LiDAR point clouds. We propose an approach that combines graph-theoretic search with data-driven learning: it searches over a set of candidate segmentations and returns one where individual segments score well according to a data-driven point-based model of "objectness". We prove that if we score a segmentation by the worst objectness among its individual segments, there is an efficient algorithm that finds the optimal worst-case segmentation among an exponentially large number of candidate segmentations. We also present an efficient algorithm for the average-case. For evaluation, we repurpose KITTI 3D detection as a segmentation benchmark and empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform past bottom-up segmentation approaches and top-down object-based algorithms on segmenting point clouds. 

Title: On-line and on-board planning and perception for quadrupedal locomotion
Abstract:  We present a legged motion planning approach for quadrupedal locomotion over challenging terrain. We decompose the problem into body action planning and footstep planning. We use a lattice representation together with a set of defined body movement primitives for computing a body action plan. The lattice representation allows us to plan versatile movements that ensure feasibility for every possible plan. To this end, we propose a set of rules that define the footstep search regions and footstep sequence given a body action. We use Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*) search that guarantees bounded suboptimal plans. Our main contribution is a planning approach that generates on-line versatile movements. Experimental trials demonstrate the performance of our planning approach in a set of challenging terrain conditions. The terrain information and plans are computed on-line and on-board. 

Title: Learning Monocular Visual Odometry through Geometry-Aware Curriculum Learning
Abstract:  Inspired by the cognitive process of humans and animals, Curriculum Learning (CL) trains a model by gradually increasing the difficulty of the training data. In this paper, we study whether CL can be applied to complex geometry problems like estimating monocular Visual Odometry (VO). Unlike existing CL approaches, we present a novel CL strategy for learning the geometry of monocular VO by gradually making the learning objective more difficult during training. To this end, we propose a novel geometry-aware objective function by jointly optimizing relative and composite transformations over small windows via bounded pose regression loss. A cascade optical flow network followed by recurrent network with a differentiable windowed composition layer, termed CL-VO, is devised to learn the proposed objective. Evaluation on three real-world datasets shows superior performance of CL-VO over state-of-the-art feature-based and learning-based VO. 

Title: Gibson Env: Real-World Perception for Embodied Agents
Abstract:  Developing visual perception models for active agents and sensorimotor control are cumbersome to be done in the physical world, as existing algorithms are too slow to efficiently learn in real-time and robots are fragile and costly. This has given rise to learning-in-simulation which consequently casts a question on whether the results transfer to real-world. In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of developing real-world perception for active agents, propose Gibson Virtual Environment for this purpose, and showcase sample perceptual tasks learned therein. Gibson is based on virtualizing real spaces, rather than using artificially designed ones, and currently includes over 1400 floor spaces from 572 full buildings. The main characteristics of Gibson are: I. being from the real-world and reflecting its semantic complexity, II. having an internal synthesis mechanism, "Goggles", enabling deploying the trained models in real-world without needing further domain adaptation, III. embodiment of agents and making them subject to constraints of physics and space. 

Title: Semi-Semantic Line-Cluster Assisted Monocular SLAM for Indoor Environments
Abstract:  This paper presents a novel method to reduce the scale drift for indoor monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We leverage the prior knowledge that in the indoor environment, the line segments form tight clusters, e.g. many door frames in a straight corridor are of the same shape, size and orientation, so the same edges of these door frames form a tight line segment cluster. We implement our method in the popular ORB-SLAM2, which also serves as our baseline. In the front end we detect the line segments in each frame and incrementally cluster them in the 3D space. In the back end, we optimize the map imposing the constraint that the line segments of the same cluster should be the same. Experimental results show that our proposed method successfully reduces the scale drift for indoor monocular SLAM. 

Title: Reasoning About Physical Interactions with Object-Oriented Prediction and Planning
Abstract:  Object-based factorizations provide a useful level of abstraction for interacting with the world. Building explicit object representations, however, often requires supervisory signals that are difficult to obtain in practice. We present a paradigm for learning object-centric representations for physical scene understanding without direct supervision of object properties. Our model, Object-Oriented Prediction and Planning (O2P2), jointly learns a perception function to map from image observations to object representations, a pairwise physics interaction function to predict the time evolution of a collection of objects, and a rendering function to map objects back to pixels. For evaluation, we consider not only the accuracy of the physical predictions of the model, but also its utility for downstream tasks that require an actionable representation of intuitive physics. After training our model on an image prediction task, we can use its learned representations to build block towers more complicated than those observed during training. 

Title: The Lyapunov Neural Network: Adaptive Stability Certification for Safe Learning of Dynamical Systems
Abstract:  Learning algorithms have shown considerable prowess in simulation by allowing robots to adapt to uncertain environments and improve their performance. However, such algorithms are rarely used in practice on safety-critical systems, since the learned policy typically does not yield any safety guarantees. That is, the required exploration may cause physical harm to the robot or its environment. In this paper, we present a method to learn accurate safety certificates for nonlinear, closed-loop dynamical systems. Specifically, we construct a neural network Lyapunov function and a training algorithm that adapts it to the shape of the largest safe region in the state space. The algorithm relies only on knowledge of inputs and outputs of the dynamics, rather than on any specific model structure. We demonstrate our method by learning the safe region of attraction for a simulated inverted pendulum. Furthermore, we discuss how our method can be used in safe learning algorithms together with statistical models of dynamical systems. 

Title: Wasserstein Distance guided Adversarial Imitation Learning with Reward Shape Exploration
Abstract:  The generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) has provided an adversarial learning framework for imitating expert policy from demonstrations in high-dimensional continuous tasks. However, almost all GAIL and its extensions only design a kind of reward function of logarithmic form in the adversarial training strategy with the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence for all complex environments. The fixed logarithmic type of reward function may be difficult to solve all complex tasks, and the vanishing gradients problem caused by the JS divergence will harm the adversarial learning process. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named Wasserstein Distance guided Adversarial Imitation Learning (WDAIL) for promoting the performance of imitation learning (IL). There are three improvements in our method: (a) introducing the Wasserstein distance to obtain more appropriate measure in adversarial training process, (b) using proximal policy optimization (PPO) in the reinforcement learning stage which is much simpler to implement and makes the algorithm more efficient, and (c) exploring different reward function shapes to suit different tasks for improving the performance. The experiment results show that the learning procedure remains remarkably stable, and achieves significant performance in the complex continuous control tasks of MuJoCo. 

Title: 3D Surface Reconstruction from Voxel-based Lidar Data
Abstract:  To achieve fully autonomous navigation, vehicles need to compute an accurate model of their direct surrounding. In this paper, a 3D surface reconstruction algorithm from heterogeneous density 3D data is presented. The proposed method is based on a TSDF voxel-based representation, where an adaptive neighborhood kernel sourced on a Gaussian confidence evaluation is introduced. This enables to keep a good trade-off between the density of the reconstructed mesh and its accuracy. Experimental evaluations carried on both synthetic (CARLA) and real (KITTI) 3D data show a good performance compared to a state of the art method used for surface reconstruction. 

Title: Smooth Deformation Field-based Mismatch Removal in Real-time
Abstract:  This paper studies the mismatch removal problem, which may serve as the subsequent step of feature matching. Non-rigid deformation makes it difficult to remove mismatches because no parametric transformation can be found. To solve this problem, we first propose an algorithm based on the re-weighting and 1-point RANSAC strategy (R1P-RNSC), which is a parametric method under a reasonable assumption that the non-rigid deformation can be approximately represented by multiple locally rigid transformations. R1P-RNSC is fast but suffers from a drawback that the local smoothing information cannot be taken into account. Then, we propose a non-parametric algorithm based on the expectation maximization algorithm and dual quaternion (EMDQ) representation to generate the smooth deformation field. The two algorithms compensate for the drawbacks of each other. Specifically, EMDQ needs good initial values provided by R1P-RNSC, and R1P-RNSC needs EMDQ for refinement. Experimental results with real-world data demonstrate that the combination of the two algorithms has the best accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods, which can handle up to 85% of outliers in real-time. The ability to generate dense deformation field from sparse matches with outliers in real-time makes the proposed algorithms have many potential applications, such as non-rigid registration and SLAM. 

Title: Uncertainty-Aware Imitation Learning using Kernelized Movement Primitives
Abstract:  During the past few years, probabilistic approaches to imitation learning have earned a relevant place in the literature. One of their most prominent features, in addition to extracting a mean trajectory from task demonstrations, is that they provide a variance estimation. The intuitive meaning of this variance, however, changes across different techniques, indicating either variability or uncertainty. In this paper we leverage kernelized movement primitives (KMP) to provide a new perspective on imitation learning by predicting variability, correlations and uncertainty about robot actions. This rich set of information is used in combination with optimal controller fusion to learn actions from data, with two main advantages: i) robots become safe when uncertain about their actions and ii) they are able to leverage partial demonstrations, given as elementary sub-tasks, to optimally perform a higher level, more complex task. We showcase our approach in a painting task, where a human user and a KUKA robot collaborate to paint a wooden board. The task is divided into two sub-tasks and we show that using our approach the robot becomes compliant (hence safe) outside the training regions and executes the two sub-tasks with optimal gains. 

Title: On Support Relations and Semantic Scene Graphs
Abstract:  Scene understanding is a popular and challenging topic in both computer vision and photogrammetry. Scene graph provides rich information for such scene understanding. This paper presents a novel approach to infer such relations and then to construct the scene graph. Support relations are estimated by considering important, previously ignored information: the physical stability and the prior support knowledge between object classes. In contrast to previous methods for extracting support relations, the proposed approach generates more accurate results, and does not require a pixel-wise semantic labeling of the scene. The semantic scene graph which describes all the contextual relations within the scene is constructed using this information. To evaluate the accuracy of these graphs, multiple different measures are formulated. The proposed algorithms are evaluated using the NYUv2 database. The results demonstrate that the inferred support relations are more precise than state-of-the-art. The scene graphs are compared against ground truth graphs. 

Title: LiDARTag: A Real-Time Fiducial Tag using Point Clouds
Abstract:  Image-based fiducial markers are widely used in robotics and computer vision problems such as object tracking in cluttered or textureless environments, camera (and multi-sensor) calibration tasks, or vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The state-of-the-art fiducial marker detection algorithms rely on consistency of the ambient lighting. This paper introduces LiDARTag, a novel fiducial tag design and detection algorithm suitable for light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The proposed tag runs in real-time and can process data faster than the currently available LiDAR sensors frequencies. Due to the nature of the LiDAR's sensor, rapidly changing ambient lighting will not affect detection of a LiDARTag; hence, the proposed fiducial marker can operate in a completely dark environment. In addition, the LiDARTag nicely complements available visual fiducial markers as the tag design is compatible with available techniques, such as AprilTags, allowing for efficient multi-sensor fusion and calibration tasks. The experimental results, verified by a motion capture system, confirm the proposed technique can reliably provide a tag's pose and its unique ID code. All implementations are done in C++ and will be available soon at: https://github.com/brucejk/LiDARTag 

Title: Black-Box Data-efficient Policy Search for Robotics
Abstract:  The most data-efficient algorithms for reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics are based on uncertain dynamical models: after each episode, they first learn a dynamical model of the robot, then they use an optimization algorithm to find a policy that maximizes the expected return given the model and its uncertainties. It is often believed that this optimization can be tractable only if analytical, gradient-based algorithms are used; however, these algorithms require using specific families of reward functions and policies, which greatly limits the flexibility of the overall approach. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-based RL algorithm, called Black-DROPS (Black-box Data-efficient RObot Policy Search) that: (1) does not impose any constraint on the reward function or the policy (they are treated as black-boxes), (2) is as data-efficient as the state-of-the-art algorithm for data-efficient RL in robotics, and (3) is as fast (or faster) than analytical approaches when several cores are available. The key idea is to replace the gradient-based optimization algorithm with a parallel, black-box algorithm that takes into account the model uncertainties. We demonstrate the performance of our new algorithm on two standard control benchmark problems (in simulation) and a low-cost robotic manipulator (with a real robot). 

Title: Vision-Based Autonomous UAV Navigation and Landing for Urban Search and Rescue
Abstract:  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with bioradars are a life-saving technology that can enable identification of survivors under collapsed buildings in the aftermath of natural disasters such as earthquakes or gas explosions. However, these UAVs have to be able to autonomously navigate in disaster struck environments and land on debris piles in order to accurately locate the survivors. This problem is extremely challenging as pre-existing maps cannot be leveraged for navigation due to structural changes that may have occurred. Furthermore, existing landing site detection algorithms are not suitable to identify safe landing regions on debris piles. In this work, we present a computationally efficient system for autonomous UAV navigation and landing that does not require any prior knowledge about the environment. We propose a novel landing site detection algorithm that computes costmaps based on several hazard factors including terrain flatness, steepness, depth accuracy, and energy consumption information. We also introduce a first-of-a-kind synthetic dataset of over 1.2 million images of collapsed buildings with groundtruth depth, surface normals, semantics and camera pose information. We demonstrate the efficacy of our system using experiments from a city scale hyperrealistic simulation environment and in real-world scenarios with collapsed buildings. 

Title: The inD Dataset: A Drone Dataset of Naturalistic Road User Trajectories at German Intersections
Abstract:  Automated vehicles rely heavily on data-driven methods, especially for complex urban environments. Large datasets of real world measurement data in the form of road user trajectories are crucial for several tasks like road user prediction models or scenario-based safety validation. So far, though, this demand is unmet as no public dataset of urban road user trajectories is available in an appropriate size, quality and variety. By contrast, the highway drone dataset (highD) has recently shown that drones are an efficient method for acquiring naturalistic road user trajectories. Compared to driving studies or ground-level infrastructure sensors, one major advantage of using a drone is the possibility to record naturalistic behavior, as road users do not notice measurements taking place. Due to the ideal viewing angle, an entire intersection scenario can be measured with significantly less occlusion than with sensors at ground level. Both the class and the trajectory of each road user can be extracted from the video recordings with high precision using state-of-the-art deep neural networks. Therefore, we propose the creation of a comprehensive, large-scale urban intersection dataset with naturalistic road user behavior using camera-equipped drones as successor of the highD dataset. The resulting dataset contains more than 11500 road users including vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians at intersections in Germany and is called inD. The dataset consists of 10 hours of measurement data from four intersections and is available online for non-commercial research at: http://www.inD-dataset.com 

Title: Shared Multi-Task Imitation Learning for Indoor Self-Navigation
Abstract:  Deep imitation learning enables robots to learn from expert demonstrations to perform tasks such as lane following or obstacle avoidance. However, in the traditional imitation learning framework, one model only learns one task, and thus it lacks of the capability to support a robot to perform various different navigation tasks with one model in indoor environments. This paper proposes a new framework, Shared Multi-headed Imitation Learning(SMIL), that allows a robot to perform multiple tasks with one model without switching among different models. We model each task as a sub-policy and design a multi-headed policy to learn the shared information among related tasks by summing up activations from all sub-policies. Compared to single or non-shared multi-headed policies, this framework is able to leverage correlated information among tasks to increase performance.We have implemented this framework using a robot based on NVIDIA TX2 and performed extensive experiments in indoor environments with different baseline solutions. The results demonstrate that SMIL has doubled the performance over nonshared multi-headed policy. 

Title: DoorGym: A Scalable Door Opening Environment And Baseline Agent
Abstract:  In order to practically implement the door opening task, a policy ought to be robust to a wide distribution of door types and environment settings. Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Domain Randomization (DR) is a promising technique to enforce policy generalization, however, there are only a few accessible training environments that are inherently designed to train agents in domain randomized environments. We introduce DoorGym, an open-source door opening simulation framework designed to utilize domain randomization to train a stable policy. We intend for our environment to lie at the intersection of domain transfer, practical tasks, and realism. We also provide baseline Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft Actor-Critic implementations, which achieves success rates between 0% up to 95% for opening various types of doors in this environment. Moreover, the real-world transfer experiment shows the trained policy is able to work in the real world. Environment kit available here: https://github.com/PSVL/DoorGym/ 

Title: Scaling Robot Supervision to Hundreds of Hours with RoboTurk: Robotic Manipulation Dataset through Human Reasoning and Dexterity
Abstract:  Large, richly annotated datasets have accelerated progress in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, but replicating these successes in robotics has been challenging. While prior data collection methodologies such as self-supervision have resulted in large datasets, the data can have poor signal-to-noise ratio. By contrast, previous efforts to collect task demonstrations with humans provide better quality data, but they cannot reach the same data magnitude. Furthermore, neither approach places guarantees on the diversity of the data collected, in terms of solution strategies. In this work, we leverage and extend the RoboTurk platform to scale up data collection for robotic manipulation using remote teleoperation. The primary motivation for our platform is two-fold: (1) to address the shortcomings of prior work and increase the total quantity of manipulation data collected through human supervision by an order of magnitude without sacrificing the quality of the data and (2) to collect data on challenging manipulation tasks across several operators and observe a diverse set of emergent behaviors and solutions. We collected over 111 hours of robot manipulation data across 54 users and 3 challenging manipulation tasks in 1 week, resulting in the largest robot dataset collected via remote teleoperation. We evaluate the quality of our platform, the diversity of demonstrations in our dataset, and the utility of our dataset via quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Title: Empirical Study of Off-Policy Policy Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  The disparate experimental conditions in recent off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) literature make it difficult both for practitioners to choose a reliable estimator for their application domain, as well as for researchers to identify fruitful research directions. In this work, we present the first detailed empirical study of a broad suite of OPE methods. Based on thousands of experiments and empirical analysis, we offer a summarized set of guidelines to advance the understanding of OPE performance in practice, and suggest directions for future research. Along the way, our empirical findings challenge several commonly held beliefs about which class of approaches tends to perform well. Our accompanying software implementation serves as a first comprehensive benchmark for OPE. 

Title: Associating Grasp Configurations with Hierarchical Features in Convolutional Neural Networks
Abstract:  In this work, we provide a solution for posturing the anthropomorphic Robonaut-2 hand and arm for grasping based on visual information. A mapping from visual features extracted from a convolutional neural network (CNN) to grasp points is learned. We demonstrate that a CNN pre-trained for image classification can be applied to a grasping task based on a small set of grasping examples. Our approach takes advantage of the hierarchical nature of the CNN by identifying features that capture the hierarchical support relations between filters in different CNN layers and locating their 3D positions by tracing activations backwards in the CNN. When this backward trace terminates in the RGB-D image, important manipulable structures are thereby localized. These features that reside in different layers of the CNN are then associated with controllers that engage different kinematic subchains in the hand/arm system for grasping. A grasping dataset is collected using demonstrated hand/object relationships for Robonaut-2 to evaluate the proposed approach in terms of the precision of the resulting preshape postures. We demonstrate that this approach outperforms baseline approaches in cluttered scenarios on the grasping dataset and a point cloud based approach on a grasping task using Robonaut-2. 

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation using Simulated Locomotion Demonstrations
Abstract:  Learning robotic manipulation through reinforcement learning (RL) using only sparse reward signals is still considered a largely unsolved problem. Leveraging human demonstrations can make the learning process more sample efficient, but obtaining high-quality demonstrations can be costly or unfeasible. In this paper we propose a novel approach that introduces object-level demonstrations, i.e. examples of where the objects should be at any state. These demonstrations are generated automatically through RL hence require no expert knowledge. We observe that, during a manipulation task, an object is moved from an initial to a final position. When seen from the point of view of the object being manipulated, this induces a locomotion task that can be decoupled from the manipulation task and learnt through a physically-realistic simulator. The resulting object-level trajectories, called simulated locomotion demonstrations (SLDs), are then leveraged to define auxiliary rewards that are used to learn the manipulation policy. The proposed approach has been evaluated on 13 tasks of increasing complexity, and has been demonstrated to achieve higher success rate and faster learning rates compared to alternative algorithms. SLDs are especially beneficial for tasks like multi-object stacking and non-rigid object manipulation. 

Title: A Behavior-based Approach for Multi-agent Q-learning for Autonomous Exploration
Abstract:  The use of mobile robots is being popular over the world mainly for autonomous explorations in hazardous/ toxic or unknown environments. This exploration will be more effective and efficient if the explorations in unknown environment can be aided with the learning from past experiences. Currently reinforcement learning is getting more acceptances for implementing learning in robots from the system-environment interactions. This learning can be implemented using the concept of both single-agent and multiagent. This paper describes such a multiagent approach for implementing a type of reinforcement learning using a priority based behaviour-based architecture. This proposed methodology has been successfully tested in both indoor and outdoor environments. 

Title: Boosting Real-Time Driving Scene Parsing with Shared Semantics
Abstract:  Real-time scene parsing is a fundamental feature for autonomous driving vehicles with multiple cameras. In this letter we demonstrate that sharing semantics between cameras with different perspectives and overlapped views can boost the parsing performance when compared with traditional methods, which individually process the frames from each camera. Our framework is based on a deep neural network for semantic segmentation but with two kinds of additional modules for sharing and fusing semantics. On the one hand, a semantics sharing module is designed to establish the pixel-wise mapping between the input images. Features as well as semantics are shared by the map to reduce duplicated workload which leads to more efficient computation. On the other hand, feature fusion modules are designed to combine different modal of semantic features, which leverage the information from both inputs for better accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we have applied our network to a dual-camera vision system for driving scene parsing. Experimental results show that our network outperforms the baseline method on the parsing accuracy with comparable computations. 

Title: Neural Task Planning with And-Or Graph Representations
Abstract:  This paper focuses on semantic task planning, i.e., predicting a sequence of actions toward accomplishing a specific task under a certain scene, which is a new problem in computer vision research. The primary challenges are how to model task-specific knowledge and how to integrate this knowledge into the learning procedure. In this work, we propose training a recurrent long short-term memory (LSTM) network to address this problem, i.e., taking a scene image (including pre-located objects) and the specified task as input and recurrently predicting action sequences. However, training such a network generally requires large numbers of annotated samples to cover the semantic space (e.g., diverse action decomposition and ordering). To overcome this issue, we introduce a knowledge and-or graph (AOG) for task description, which hierarchically represents a task as atomic actions. With this AOG representation, we can produce many valid samples (i.e., action sequences according to common sense) by training another auxiliary LSTM network with a small set of annotated samples. Furthermore, these generated samples (i.e., task-oriented action sequences) effectively facilitate training of the model for semantic task planning. In our experiments, we create a new dataset that contains diverse daily tasks and extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. 

Title: PixelNet: Representation of the pixels, by the pixels, and for the pixels
Abstract:  We explore design principles for general pixel-level prediction problems, from low-level edge detection to mid-level surface normal estimation to high-level semantic segmentation. Convolutional predictors, such as the fully-convolutional network (FCN), have achieved remarkable success by exploiting the spatial redundancy of neighboring pixels through convolutional processing. Though computationally efficient, we point out that such approaches are not statistically efficient during learning precisely because spatial redundancy limits the information learned from neighboring pixels. We demonstrate that stratified sampling of pixels allows one to (1) add diversity during batch updates, speeding up learning; (2) explore complex nonlinear predictors, improving accuracy; and (3) efficiently train state-of-the-art models tabula rasa (i.e., "from scratch") for diverse pixel-labeling tasks. Our single architecture produces state-of-the-art results for semantic segmentation on PASCAL-Context dataset, surface normal estimation on NYUDv2 depth dataset, and edge detection on BSDS. 

Title: Self-Supervised Visual Planning with Temporal Skip Connections
Abstract:  In order to autonomously learn wide repertoires of complex skills, robots must be able to learn from their own autonomously collected data, without human supervision. One learning signal that is always available for autonomously collected data is prediction: if a robot can learn to predict the future, it can use this predictive model to take actions to produce desired outcomes, such as moving an object to a particular location. However, in complex open-world scenarios, designing a representation for prediction is difficult. In this work, we instead aim to enable self-supervised robotic learning through direct video prediction: instead of attempting to design a good representation, we directly predict what the robot will see next, and then use this model to achieve desired goals. A key challenge in video prediction for robotic manipulation is handling complex spatial arrangements such as occlusions. To that end, we introduce a video prediction model that can keep track of objects through occlusion by incorporating temporal skip-connections. Together with a novel planning criterion and action space formulation, we demonstrate that this model substantially outperforms prior work on video prediction-based control. Our results show manipulation of objects not seen during training, handling multiple objects, and pushing objects around obstructions. These results represent a significant advance in the range and complexity of skills that can be performed entirely with self-supervised robotic learning. 

Title: Real-time Lane Marker Detection Using Template Matching with RGB-D Camera
Abstract:  This paper addresses the problem of lane detection which is fundamental for self-driving vehicles. Our approach exploits both colour and depth information recorded by a single RGB-D camera to better deal with negative factors such as lighting conditions and lane-like objects. In the approach, colour and depth images are first converted to a half-binary format and a 2D matrix of 3D points. They are then used as the inputs of template matching and geometric feature extraction processes to form a response map so that its values represent the probability of pixels being lane markers. To further improve the results, the template and lane surfaces are finally refined by principal component analysis and lane model fitting techniques. A number of experiments have been conducted on both synthetic and real datasets. The result shows that the proposed approach can effectively eliminate unwanted noise to accurately detect lane markers in various scenarios. Moreover, the processing speed of 20 frames per second under hardware configuration of a popular laptop computer allows the proposed algorithm to be implemented for real-time autonomous driving applications. 

Title: Simple Physical Adversarial Examples against End-to-End Autonomous Driving Models
Abstract:  Recent advances in machine learning, especially techniques such as deep neural networks, are promoting a range of high-stakes applications, including autonomous driving, which often relies on deep learning for perception. While deep learning for perception has been shown to be vulnerable to a host of subtle adversarial manipulations of images, end-to-end demonstrations of successful attacks, which manipulate the physical environment and result in physical consequences, are scarce. Moreover, attacks typically involve carefully constructed adversarial examples at the level of pixels. We demonstrate the first end-to-end attacks on autonomous driving in simulation, using simple physically realizable attacks: the painting of black lines on the road. These attacks target deep neural network models for end-to-end autonomous driving control. A systematic investigation shows that such attacks are surprisingly easy to engineer, and we describe scenarios (e.g., right turns) in which they are highly effective, and others that are less vulnerable (e.g., driving straight). Further, we use network deconvolution to demonstrate that the attacks succeed by inducing activation patterns similar to entirely different scenarios used in training. 

Title: Neural Topological SLAM for Visual Navigation
Abstract:  This paper studies the problem of image-goal navigation which involves navigating to the location indicated by a goal image in a novel previously unseen environment. To tackle this problem, we design topological representations for space that effectively leverage semantics and afford approximate geometric reasoning. At the heart of our representations are nodes with associated semantic features, that are interconnected using coarse geometric information. We describe supervised learning-based algorithms that can build, maintain and use such representations under noisy actuation. Experimental study in visually and physically realistic simulation suggests that our method builds effective representations that capture structural regularities and efficiently solve long-horizon navigation problems. We observe a relative improvement of more than 50% over existing methods that study this task. 

Title: Guided Constrained Policy Optimization for Dynamic Quadrupedal Robot Locomotion
Abstract:  Deep reinforcement learning (RL) uses model-free techniques to optimize task-specific control policies. Despite having emerged as a promising approach for complex problems, RL is still hard to use reliably for real-world applications. Apart from challenges such as precise reward function tuning, inaccurate sensing and actuation, and non-deterministic response, existing RL methods do not guarantee behavior within required safety constraints that are crucial for real robot scenarios. In this regard, we introduce guided constrained policy optimization (GCPO), an RL framework based upon our implementation of constrained proximal policy optimization (CPPO) for tracking base velocity commands while following the defined constraints. We also introduce schemes which encourage state recovery into constrained regions in case of constraint violations. We present experimental results of our training method and test it on the real ANYmal quadruped robot. We compare our approach against the unconstrained RL method and show that guided constrained RL offers faster convergence close to the desired optimum resulting in an optimal, yet physically feasible, robotic control behavior without the need for precise reward function tuning. 

Title: Control of the Final-Phase of Closed-Loop Visual Grasping using Image-Based Visual Servoing
Abstract:  This paper considers the final approach phase of visual-closed-loop grasping where the RGB-D camera is no longer able to provide valid depth information. Many current robotic grasping controllers are not closed-loop and therefore fail for moving objects. Closed-loop grasp controllers based on RGB-D imagery can track a moving object, but fail when the sensor's minimum object distance is violated just before grasping. To overcome this we propose the use of image-based visual servoing (IBVS) to guide the robot to the object-relative grasp pose using camera RGB information. IBVS robustly moves the camera to a goal pose defined implicitly in terms of an image-plane feature configuration. In this work, the goal image feature coordinates are predicted from RGB-D data to enable RGB-only tracking once depth data becomes unavailable -- this enables more reliable grasping of previously unseen moving objects. Experimental results are provided. 

Title: Generic Prediction Architecture Considering both Rational and Irrational Driving Behaviors
Abstract:  Accurately predicting future behaviors of surrounding vehicles is an essential capability for autonomous vehicles in order to plan safe and feasible trajectories. The behaviors of others, however, are full of uncertainties. Both rational and irrational behaviors exist, and the autonomous vehicles need to be aware of this in their prediction module. The prediction module is also expected to generate reasonable results in the presence of unseen and corner scenarios. Two types of prediction models are typically used to solve the prediction problem: learning-based model and planning-based model. Learning-based model utilizes real driving data to model the human behaviors. Depending on the structure of the data, learning-based models can predict both rational and irrational behaviors. But the balance between them cannot be customized, which creates challenges in generalizing the prediction results. Planning-based model, on the other hand, usually assumes human as a rational agent, i.e., it anticipates only rational behavior of human drivers. In this paper, a generic prediction architecture is proposed to address various rationalities in human behavior. We leverage the advantages from both learning-based and planning-based prediction models. The proposed approach is able to predict continuous trajectories that well-reflect possible future situations of other drivers. Moreover, the prediction performance remains stable under various unseen driving scenarios. A case study under a real-world roundabout scenario is provided to demonstrate the performance and capability of the proposed prediction architecture. 

Title: TrueBranch: Metric Learning-based Verification of Forest Conservation Projects
Abstract:  International stakeholders increasingly invest in offsetting carbon emissions, for example, via issuing Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) to forest conservation projects. Issuing trusted payments requires a transparent monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) process of the ecosystem services (e.g., carbon stored in forests). The current MRV process, however, is either too expensive (on-ground inspection of forest) or inaccurate (satellite). Recent works propose low-cost and accurate MRV via automatically determining forest carbon from drone imagery, collected by the landowners. The automation of MRV, however, opens up the possibility that landowners report untruthful drone imagery. To be robust against untruthful reporting, we propose TrueBranch, a metric learning-based algorithm that verifies the truthfulness of drone imagery from forest conservation projects. TrueBranch aims to detect untruthfully reported drone imagery by matching it with public satellite imagery. Preliminary results suggest that nominal distance metrics are not sufficient to reliably detect untruthfully reported imagery. TrueBranch leverages metric learning to create a feature embedding in which truthfully and untruthfully collected imagery is easily distinguishable by distance thresholding. 

Title: EasyLabel: A Semi-Automatic Pixel-wise Object Annotation Tool for Creating Robotic RGB-D Datasets
Abstract:  Developing robot perception systems for recognizing objects in the real-world requires computer vision algorithms to be carefully scrutinized with respect to the expected operating domain. This demands large quantities of ground truth data to rigorously evaluate the performance of algorithms. This paper presents the EasyLabel tool for easily acquiring high quality ground truth annotation of objects at the pixel-level in densely cluttered scenes. In a semi-automatic process, complex scenes are incrementally built and EasyLabel exploits depth change to extract precise object masks at each step. We use this tool to generate the Object Cluttered Indoor Dataset (OCID) that captures diverse settings of objects, background, context, sensor to scene distance, viewpoint angle and lighting conditions. OCID is used to perform a systematic comparison of existing object segmentation methods. The baseline comparison supports the need for pixel- and object-wise annotation to progress robot vision towards realistic applications. This insight reveals the usefulness of EasyLabel and OCID to better understand the challenges that robots face in the real-world. Copyright 20XX IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

Title: On the Covariance of ICP-based Scan-matching Techniques
Abstract:  This paper considers the problem of estimating the covariance of roto-translations computed by the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. The problem is relevant for localization of mobile robots and vehicles equipped with depth-sensing cameras (e.g., Kinect) or Lidar (e.g., Velodyne). The closed-form formulas for covariance proposed in previous literature generally build upon the fact that the solution to ICP is obtained by minimizing a linear least-squares problem. In this paper, we show this approach needs caution because the rematching step of the algorithm is not explicitly accounted for, and applying it to the point-to-point version of ICP leads to completely erroneous covariances. We then provide a formal mathematical proof why the approach is valid in the point-to-plane version of ICP, which validates the intuition and experimental results of practitioners. 

Title: An LSTM Network for Highway Trajectory Prediction
Abstract:  In order to drive safely and efficiently on public roads, autonomous vehicles will have to understand the intentions of surrounding vehicles, and adapt their own behavior accordingly. If experienced human drivers are generally good at inferring other vehicles' motion up to a few seconds in the future, most current Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) are unable to perform such medium-term forecasts, and are usually limited to high-likelihood situations such as emergency braking. In this article, we present a first step towards consistent trajectory prediction by introducing a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, which is capable of accurately predicting future longitudinal and lateral trajectories for vehicles on highway. Unlike previous work focusing on a low number of trajectories collected from a few drivers, our network was trained and validated on the NGSIM US-101 dataset, which contains a total of 800 hours of recorded trajectories in various traffic densities, representing more than 6000 individual drivers. 

Title: Coresets for Kinematic Data: From Theorems to Real-Time Systems
Abstract:  A coreset (or core-set) of a dataset is its semantic compression with respect to a set of queries, such that querying the (small) coreset provably yields an approximate answer to querying the original (full) dataset. In the last decade, coresets provided breakthroughs in theoretical computer science for approximation algorithms, and more recently, in the machine learning community for learning "Big data". However, we are not aware of real-time systems that compute coresets in a rate of dozens of frames per second. In this paper we suggest a framework to turn theorems to such systems using coresets. We begin with a proof of independent interest, that any set of $n$ matrices in $\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ whose sum is $S$, has a positively weighted subset whose sum has the same center of mass (mean) and orientation (left+right singular vectors) as $S$, and consists of $O(dr)$ matrices (independent of $n$), where $r\leq d$ is the rank of $S$. We provide an algorithm that computes this (core) set in one pass over possibly infinite stream of matrices in $d^{O(1)}$ time per matrix insertion. By maintaining such a coreset for kinematic (moving) set of $n$ points, we can run pose-estimation algorithms, such as Kabsch or PnP, on the small coresets, instead of the $n$ points, in real-time using weak devices, while obtaining the same results. This enabled us to implement a low-cost ($<\$100$) IoT wireless system that tracks a toy (and harmless) quadcopter which guides guests to a desired room (in a hospital, mall, hotel, museum, etc.) with no help of additional human or remote controller. We hope that our framework will encourage researchers outside the theoretical community to design and use coresets in future systems and papers. To this end, we provide extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real data, as well as a link to the open code of our system and algorithms. 

Title: Online Deep Learning for Improved Trajectory Tracking of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Using Expert Knowledge
Abstract:  This work presents an online learning-based control method for improved trajectory tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles using both deep learning and expert knowledge. The proposed method does not require the exact model of the system to be controlled, and it is robust against variations in system dynamics as well as operational uncertainties. The learning is divided into two phases: offline (pre-)training and online (post-)training. In the former, a conventional controller performs a set of trajectories and, based on the input-output dataset, the deep neural network (DNN)-based controller is trained. In the latter, the trained DNN, which mimics the conventional controller, controls the system. Unlike the existing papers in the literature, the network is still being trained for different sets of trajectories which are not used in the training phase of DNN. Thanks to the rule-base, which contains the expert knowledge, the proposed framework learns the system dynamics and operational uncertainties in real-time. The experimental results show that the proposed online learning-based approach gives better trajectory tracking performance when compared to the only offline trained network. 

Title: YCB-M: A Multi-Camera RGB-D Dataset for Object Recognition and 6DoF Pose Estimation
Abstract:  While a great variety of 3D cameras have been introduced in recent years, most publicly available datasets for object recognition and pose estimation focus on one single camera. In this work, we present a dataset of 32 scenes that have been captured by 7 different 3D cameras, totaling 49,294 frames. This allows evaluating the sensitivity of pose estimation algorithms to the specifics of the used camera and the development of more robust algorithms that are more independent of the camera model. Vice versa, our dataset enables researchers to perform a quantitative comparison of the data from several different cameras and depth sensing technologies and evaluate their algorithms before selecting a camera for their specific task. The scenes in our dataset contain 20 different objects from the common benchmark YCB object and model set [1], [2]. We provide full ground truth 6DoF poses for each object, per-pixel segmentation, 2D and 3D bounding boxes and a measure of the amount of occlusion of each object. We have also performed an initial evaluation of the cameras using our dataset on a state-of-the-art object recognition and pose estimation system [3]. 

Title: Probably Approximately Correct MDP Learning and Control With Temporal Logic Constraints
Abstract:  We consider synthesis of control policies that maximize the probability of satisfying given temporal logic specifications in unknown, stochastic environments. We model the interaction between the system and its environment as a Markov decision process (MDP) with initially unknown transition probabilities. The solution we develop builds on the so-called model-based probably approximately correct Markov decision process (PAC-MDP) methodology. The algorithm attains an $\varepsilon$-approximately optimal policy with probability $1-\delta$ using samples (i.e. observations), time and space that grow polynomially with the size of the MDP, the size of the automaton expressing the temporal logic specification, $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, $\frac{1}{\delta}$ and a finite time horizon. In this approach, the system maintains a model of the initially unknown MDP, and constructs a product MDP based on its learned model and the specification automaton that expresses the temporal logic constraints. During execution, the policy is iteratively updated using observation of the transitions taken by the system. The iteration terminates in finitely many steps. With high probability, the resulting policy is such that, for any state, the difference between the probability of satisfying the specification under this policy and the optimal one is within a predefined bound. 

Title: RoboTHOR: An Open Simulation-to-Real Embodied AI Platform
Abstract:  Visual recognition ecosystems (e.g. ImageNet, Pascal, COCO) have undeniably played a prevailing role in the evolution of modern computer vision. We argue that interactive and embodied visual AI has reached a stage of development similar to visual recognition prior to the advent of these ecosystems. Recently, various synthetic environments have been introduced to facilitate research in embodied AI. Notwithstanding this progress, the crucial question of how well models trained in simulation generalize to reality has remained largely unanswered. The creation of a comparable ecosystem for simulation-to-real embodied AI presents many challenges: (1) the inherently interactive nature of the problem, (2) the need for tight alignments between real and simulated worlds, (3) the difficulty of replicating physical conditions for repeatable experiments, (4) and the associated cost. In this paper, we introduce RoboTHOR to democratize research in interactive and embodied visual AI. RoboTHOR offers a framework of simulated environments paired with physical counterparts to systematically explore and overcome the challenges of simulation-to-real transfer, and a platform where researchers across the globe can remotely test their embodied models in the physical world. As a first benchmark, our experiments show there exists a significant gap between the performance of models trained in simulation when they are tested in both simulations and their carefully constructed physical analogs. We hope that RoboTHOR will spur the next stage of evolution in embodied computer vision. RoboTHOR can be accessed at the following link: https://ai2thor.allenai.org/robothor 

Title: Self-Supervised Drivable Area and Road Anomaly Segmentation using RGB-D Data for Robotic Wheelchairs
Abstract:  The segmentation of drivable areas and road anomalies are critical capabilities to achieve autonomous navigation for robotic wheelchairs. The recent progress of semantic segmentation using deep learning techniques has presented effective results. However, the acquisition of large-scale datasets with hand-labeled ground truth is time-consuming and labor-intensive, making the deep learning-based methods often hard to implement in practice. We contribute to the solution of this problem for the task of drivable area and road anomaly segmentation by proposing a self-supervised learning approach. We develop a pipeline that can automatically generate segmentation labels for drivable areas and road anomalies. Then, we train RGB-D data-based semantic segmentation neural networks and get predicted labels. Experimental results show that our proposed automatic labeling pipeline achieves an impressive speed-up compared to manual labeling. In addition, our proposed self-supervised approach exhibits more robust and accurate results than the state-of-the-art traditional algorithms as well as the state-of-the-art self-supervised algorithms. 

Title: Gaussian Process Planning with Lipschitz Continuous Reward Functions: Towards Unifying Bayesian Optimization, Active Learning, and Beyond
Abstract:  This paper presents a novel nonmyopic adaptive Gaussian process planning (GPP) framework endowed with a general class of Lipschitz continuous reward functions that can unify some active learning/sensing and Bayesian optimization criteria and offer practitioners some flexibility to specify their desired choices for defining new tasks/problems. In particular, it utilizes a principled Bayesian sequential decision problem framework for jointly and naturally optimizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. In general, the resulting induced GPP policy cannot be derived exactly due to an uncountable set of candidate observations. A key contribution of our work here thus lies in exploiting the Lipschitz continuity of the reward functions to solve for a nonmyopic adaptive epsilon-optimal GPP (epsilon-GPP) policy. To plan in real time, we further propose an asymptotically optimal, branch-and-bound anytime variant of epsilon-GPP with performance guarantee. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our epsilon-GPP policy and its anytime variant in Bayesian optimization and an energy harvesting task. 

Title: Estimating Motion Codes from Demonstration Videos
Abstract:  A motion taxonomy can encode manipulations as a binary-encoded representation, which we refer to as motion codes. These motion codes innately represent a manipulation action in an embedded space that describes the motion's mechanical features, including contact and trajectory type. The key advantage of using motion codes for embedding is that motions can be more appropriately defined with robotic-relevant features, and their distances can be more reasonably measured using these motion features. In this paper, we develop a deep learning pipeline to extract motion codes from demonstration videos in an unsupervised manner so that knowledge from these videos can be properly represented and used for robots. Our evaluations show that motion codes can be extracted from demonstrations of action in the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset. 

Title: The Ingredients of Real-World Robotic Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  The success of reinforcement learning for real world robotics has been, in many cases limited to instrumented laboratory scenarios, often requiring arduous human effort and oversight to enable continuous learning. In this work, we discuss the elements that are needed for a robotic learning system that can continually and autonomously improve with data collected in the real world. We propose a particular instantiation of such a system, using dexterous manipulation as our case study. Subsequently, we investigate a number of challenges that come up when learning without instrumentation. In such settings, learning must be feasible without manually designed resets, using only on-board perception, and without hand-engineered reward functions. We propose simple and scalable solutions to these challenges, and then demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed system on a set of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks, providing an in-depth analysis of the challenges associated with this learning paradigm. We demonstrate that our complete system can learn without any human intervention, acquiring a variety of vision-based skills with a real-world three-fingered hand.

Title: Propagation Networks for Model-Based Control Under Partial Observation
Abstract:  There has been an increasing interest in learning dynamics simulators for model-based control. Compared with off-the-shelf physics engines, a learnable simulator can quickly adapt to unseen objects, scenes, and tasks. However, existing models like interaction networks only work for fully observable systems; they also only consider pairwise interactions within a single time step, both restricting their use in practical systems. We introduce Propagation Networks (PropNet), a differentiable, learnable dynamics model that handles partially observable scenarios and enables instantaneous propagation of signals beyond pairwise interactions. Experiments show that our propagation networks not only outperform current learnable physics engines in forward simulation, but also achieve superior performance on various control tasks. Compared with existing model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms, model-based control with propagation networks is more accurate, efficient, and generalizable to new, partially observable scenes and tasks. 

Title: Knowledge Representations in Technical Systems -- A Taxonomy
Abstract:  The recent usage of technical systems in human-centric environments leads to the question, how to teach technical systems, e.g., robots, to understand, learn, and perform tasks desired by the human. Therefore, an accurate representation of knowledge is essential for the system to work as expected. This article mainly gives insight into different knowledge representation techniques and their categorization into various problem domains in artificial intelligence. Additionally, applications of presented knowledge representations are introduced in everyday robotics tasks. By means of the provided taxonomy, the search for a proper knowledge representation technique regarding a specific problem should be facilitated. 

Title: Soft Actor-Critic Algorithms and Applications
Abstract:  Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been successfully applied to a range of challenging sequential decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: high sample complexity and brittleness to hyperparameters. Both of these challenges limit the applicability of such methods to real-world domains. In this paper, we describe Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our recently introduced off-policy actor-critic algorithm based on the maximum entropy RL framework. In this framework, the actor aims to simultaneously maximize expected return and entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. We extend SAC to incorporate a number of modifications that accelerate training and improve stability with respect to the hyperparameters, including a constrained formulation that automatically tunes the temperature hyperparameter. We systematically evaluate SAC on a range of benchmark tasks, as well as real-world challenging tasks such as locomotion for a quadrupedal robot and robotic manipulation with a dexterous hand. With these improvements, SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods in sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving similar performance across different random seeds. These results suggest that SAC is a promising candidate for learning in real-world robotics tasks. 

Title: Design and Control of Roller Grasper V2 for In-Hand Manipulation
Abstract:  The ability to perform in-hand manipulation still remains an unsolved problem; having this capability would allow robots to perform sophisticated tasks requiring repositioning and reorienting of grasped objects. In this work, we present a novel non-anthropomorphic robot grasper with the ability to manipulate objects by means of active surfaces at the fingertips. Active surfaces are achieved by spherical rolling finger tips with two degrees of freedom (DoF) -- a pivoting motion for surface reorientation -- and a continuous rolling motion for moving the object. A further DoF is in the base of each finger, allowing the fingers to grasp objects over a range of size and shapes. Instantaneous kinematics was derived and objects were successfully manipulated both with a custom hard-coded control scheme as well as one learned through imitation learning, in simulation and experimentally on the hardware. 

Title: Highly Parallelized Data-driven MPC for Minimal Intervention Shared Control
Abstract:  We present a shared control paradigm that improves a user's ability to operate complex, dynamic systems in potentially dangerous environments without a priori knowledge of the user's objective. In this paradigm, the role of the autonomous partner is to improve the general safety of the system without constraining the user's ability to achieve unspecified behaviors. Our approach relies on a data-driven, model-based representation of the joint human-machine system to evaluate, in parallel, a significant number of potential inputs that the user may wish to provide. These samples are used to (1) predict the safety of the system over a receding horizon, and (2) minimize the influence of the autonomous partner. The resulting shared control algorithm maximizes the authority allocated to the human partner to improve their sense of agency, while improving safety. We evaluate the efficacy of our shared control algorithm with a human subjects study (n=20) conducted in two simulated environments: a balance bot and a race car. During the experiment, users are free to operate each system however they would like (i.e., there is no specified task) and are only asked to try to avoid unsafe regions of the state space. Using modern computational resources (i.e., GPUs) our approach is able to consider more than 10,000 potential trajectories at each time step in a control loop running at 100Hz for the balance bot and 60Hz for the race car. The results of the study show that our shared control paradigm improves system safety without knowledge of the user's goal, while maintaining high-levels of user satisfaction and low-levels of frustration. Our code is available online at https://github.com/asbroad/mpmi_shared_control. 

Title: Long-Horizon Visual Planning with Goal-Conditioned Hierarchical Predictors
Abstract:  The ability to predict and plan into the future is fundamental for agents acting in the world. To reach a faraway goal, we predict trajectories at multiple timescales, first devising a coarse plan towards the goal and then gradually filling in details. In contrast, current learning approaches for visual prediction and planning fail on long-horizon tasks as they generate predictions (1) without considering goal information, and (2) at the finest temporal resolution, one step at a time. In this work we propose a framework for visual prediction and planning that is able to overcome both of these limitations. First, we formulate the problem of predicting towards a goal and propose the corresponding class of latent space goal-conditioned predictors (GCPs). GCPs significantly improve planning efficiency by constraining the search space to only those trajectories that reach the goal. Further, we show how GCPs can be naturally formulated as hierarchical models that, given two observations, predict an observation between them, and by recursively subdividing each part of the trajectory generate complete sequences. This divide-and-conquer strategy is effective at long-term prediction, and enables us to design an effective hierarchical planning algorithm that optimizes trajectories in a coarse-to-fine manner. We show that by using both goal-conditioning and hierarchical prediction, GCPs enable us to solve visual planning tasks with much longer horizon than previously possible. 

Title: Active Perception using Light Curtains for Autonomous Driving
Abstract:  Most real-world 3D sensors such as LiDARs perform fixed scans of the entire environment, while being decoupled from the recognition system that processes the sensor data. In this work, we propose a method for 3D object recognition using light curtains, a resource-efficient controllable sensor that measures depth at user-specified locations in the environment. Crucially, we propose using prediction uncertainty of a deep learning based 3D point cloud detector to guide active perception. Given a neural network's uncertainty, we derive an optimization objective to place light curtains using the principle of maximizing information gain. Then, we develop a novel and efficient optimization algorithm to maximize this objective by encoding the physical constraints of the device into a constraint graph and optimizing with dynamic programming. We show how a 3D detector can be trained to detect objects in a scene by sequentially placing uncertainty-guided light curtains to successively improve detection accuracy. Code and details can be found on the project webpage: http://siddancha.github.io/projects/active-perception-light-curtains. 

Title: SelectFusion: A Generic Framework to Selectively Learn Multisensory Fusion
Abstract:  Autonomous vehicles and mobile robotic systems are typically equipped with multiple sensors to provide redundancy. By integrating the observations from different sensors, these mobile agents are able to perceive the environment and estimate system states, e.g. locations and orientations. Although deep learning approaches for multimodal odometry estimation and localization have gained traction, they rarely focus on the issue of robust sensor fusion - a necessary consideration to deal with noisy or incomplete sensor observations in the real world. Moreover, current deep odometry models also suffer from a lack of interpretability. To this extent, we propose SelectFusion, an end-to-end selective sensor fusion module which can be applied to useful pairs of sensor modalities such as monocular images and inertial measurements, depth images and LIDAR point clouds. During prediction, the network is able to assess the reliability of the latent features from different sensor modalities and estimate both trajectory at scale and global pose. In particular, we propose two fusion modules based on different attention strategies: deterministic soft fusion and stochastic hard fusion, and we offer a comprehensive study of the new strategies compared to trivial direct fusion. We evaluate all fusion strategies in both ideal conditions and on progressively degraded datasets that present occlusions, noisy and missing data and time misalignment between sensors, and we investigate the effectiveness of the different fusion strategies in attending the most reliable features, which in itself, provides insights into the operation of the various models. 

Title: VH-HFCN based Parking Slot and Lane Markings Segmentation on Panoramic Surround View
Abstract:  The automatic parking is being massively developed by car manufacturers and providers. Until now, there are two problems with the automatic parking. First, there is no openly-available segmentation labels of parking slot on panoramic surround view (PSV) dataset. Second, how to detect parking slot and road structure robustly. Therefore, in this paper, we build up a public PSV dataset. At the same time, we proposed a highly fused convolutional network (HFCN) based segmentation method for parking slot and lane markings based on the PSV dataset. A surround-view image is made of four calibrated images captured from four fisheye cameras. We collect and label more than 4,200 surround view images for this task, which contain various illuminated scenes of different types of parking slots. A VH-HFCN network is proposed, which adopts an HFCN as the base, with an extra efficient VH-stage for better segmenting various markings. The VH-stage consists of two independent linear convolution paths with vertical and horizontal convolution kernels respectively. This modification enables the network to robustly and precisely extract linear features. We evaluated our model on the PSV dataset and the results showed outstanding performance in ground markings segmentation. Based on the segmented markings, parking slots and lanes are acquired by skeletonization, hough line transform and line arrangement. 

Title: ROS2Learn: a reinforcement learning framework for ROS 2
Abstract:  We propose a novel framework for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in modular robotics to train a robot directly from joint states, using traditional robotic tools. We use an state-of-the-art implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization, Trust Region Policy Optimization and Actor-Critic Kronecker-Factored Trust Region algorithms to learn policies in four different Modular Articulated Robotic Arm (MARA) environments. We support this process using a framework that communicates with typical tools used in robotics, such as Gazebo and Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). We evaluate several algorithms in modular robots with an empirical study in simulation. 

Title: Using PCA to Efficiently Represent State Spaces
Abstract:  Reinforcement learning algorithms need to deal with the exponential growth of states and actions when exploring optimal control in high-dimensional spaces. This is known as the curse of dimensionality. By projecting the agent's state onto a low-dimensional manifold, we can represent the state space in a smaller and more efficient representation. By using this representation during learning, the agent can converge to a good policy much faster. We test this approach in the Mario Benchmarking Domain. When using dimensionality reduction in Mario, learning converges much faster to a good policy. But, there is a critical convergence-performance trade-off. By projecting onto a low-dimensional manifold, we are ignoring important data. In this paper, we explore this trade-off of convergence and performance. We find that learning in as few as 4 dimensions (instead of 9), we can improve performance past learning in the full dimensional space at a faster convergence rate. 

Title: Skew-Fit: State-Covering Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Autonomous agents that must exhibit flexible and broad capabilities will need to be equipped with large repertoires of skills. Defining each skill with a manually-designed reward function limits this repertoire and imposes a manual engineering burden. Self-supervised agents that set their own goals can automate this process, but designing appropriate goal setting objectives can be difficult, and often involves heuristic design decisions. In this paper, we propose a formal exploration objective for goal-reaching policies that maximizes state coverage. We show that this objective is equivalent to maximizing goal reaching performance together with the entropy of the goal distribution, where goals correspond to full state observations. To instantiate this principle, we present an algorithm called Skew-Fit for learning a maximum-entropy goal distributions. We prove that, under regularity conditions, Skew-Fit converges to a uniform distribution over the set of valid states, even when we do not know this set beforehand. Our experiments show that combining Skew-Fit for learning goal distributions with existing goal-reaching methods outperforms a variety of prior methods on open-sourced visual goal-reaching tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that Skew-Fit enables a real-world robot to learn to open a door, entirely from scratch, from pixels, and without any manually-designed reward function. 

Title: MergeNet: A Deep Net Architecture for Small Obstacle Discovery
Abstract:  We present here, a novel network architecture called MergeNet for discovering small obstacles for on-road scenes in the context of autonomous driving. The basis of the architecture rests on the central consideration of training with less amount of data since the physical setup and the annotation process for small obstacles is hard to scale. For making effective use of the limited data, we propose a multi-stage training procedure involving weight-sharing, separate learning of low and high level features from the RGBD input and a refining stage which learns to fuse the obtained complementary features. The model is trained and evaluated on the Lost and Found dataset and is able to achieve state-of-art results with just 135 images in comparison to the 1000 images used by the previous benchmark. Additionally, we also compare our results with recent methods trained on 6000 images and show that our method achieves comparable performance with only 1000 training samples. 

Title: Challenges of Real-World Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its worth in a series of artificial domains, and is beginning to show some successes in real-world scenarios. However, much of the research advances in RL are often hard to leverage in real-world systems due to a series of assumptions that are rarely satisfied in practice. We present a set of nine unique challenges that must be addressed to productionize RL to real world problems. For each of these challenges, we specify the exact meaning of the challenge, present some approaches from the literature, and specify some metrics for evaluating that challenge. An approach that addresses all nine challenges would be applicable to a large number of real world problems. We also present an example domain that has been modified to present these challenges as a testbed for practical RL research. 

Title: A Multimodal Target-Source Classifier with Attention Branches to Understand Ambiguous Instructions for Fetching Daily Objects
Abstract:  In this study, we focus on multimodal language understanding for fetching instructions in the domestic service robots context. This task consists of predicting a target object, as instructed by the user, given an image and an unstructured sentence, such as "Bring me the yellow box (from the wooden cabinet)." This is challenging because of the ambiguity of natural language, i.e., the relevant information may be missing or there might be several candidates. To solve such a task, we propose the multimodal target-source classifier model with attention branches (MTCM-AB), which is an extension of the MTCM. Our methodology uses the attention branch network (ABN) to develop a multimodal attention mechanism based on linguistic and visual inputs. Experimental validation using a standard dataset showed that the MTCM-AB outperformed both state-of-the-art methods and the MTCM. In particular the MTCM-AB accuracy on average was 90.1% while human performance was 90.3% on the PFN-PIC dataset. 

Title: End to End Vehicle Lateral Control Using a Single Fisheye Camera
Abstract:  Convolutional neural networks are commonly used to control the steering angle for autonomous cars. Most of the time, multiple long range cameras are used to generate lateral failure cases. In this paper we present a novel model to generate this data and label augmentation using only one short range fisheye camera. We present our simulator and how it can be used as a consistent metric for lateral end-to-end control evaluation. Experiments are conducted on a custom dataset corresponding to more than 10000 km and 200 hours of open road driving. Finally we evaluate this model on real world driving scenarios, open road and a custom test track with challenging obstacle avoidance and sharp turns. In our simulator based on real-world videos, the final model was capable of more than 99% autonomy on urban road 

Title: Fast Lidar Clustering by Density and Connectivity
Abstract:  Lidar sensors are widely used in various applications, ranging from scientific fields over industrial use to integration in consumer products. With an ever growing number of different driver assistance systems, they have been introduced to automotive series production in recent years and are considered an important building block for the practical realisation of autonomous driving. However, due to the potentially large amount of Lidar points per scan, tailored algorithms are required to identify objects (e.g. pedestrians or vehicles) with high precision in a very short time. In this work, we propose an algorithmic approach for real-time instance segmentation of Lidar sensor data. We show how our method leverages the properties of the Euclidean distance to retain three-dimensional measurement information, while being narrowed down to a two-dimensional representation for fast computation. We further introduce what we call skip connections, to make our approach robust against over-segmentation and improve assignment in cases of partial occlusion. Through detailed evaluation on public data and comparison with established methods, we show how these aspects enable state-of-the-art performance and runtime on a single CPU core. 

Title: Object Sorting Using a Global Texture-Shape 3D Feature Descriptor
Abstract:  Object recognition and grasping plays a key role in robotic systems, especially for the autonomous robots to implement object sorting tasks in a warehouse. In this paper, we present a global texture-shape 3D feature descriptor which can be utilized in a system of object recognition and grasping, and can perform object sorting tasks well. Our proposed descriptor stems from the clustered viewpoint feature histogram (CVFH), which relies on the geometrical information of the whole 3D object surface only, and can not perform well in recognizing the objects with similar geometrical information. Therefore, we extend the CVFH descriptor with texture and color information to generate a new global 3D feature descriptor. The proposed descriptor is evaluated in tasks of recognizing and classifying 3D objects by applying multi-class support vector machines (SVM) in both public 3D image dataset and real scenes. The results of evaluation show that the proposed descriptor achieves a significant better performance for object recognition compared with the original CVFH. Then, the proposed descriptor is applied in our object recognition and grasping system, showing that the proposed descriptor helps the system implement the object recognition, object grasping and object sorting tasks well. 

Title: A Distributional View on Multi-Objective Policy Optimization
Abstract:  Many real-world problems require trading off multiple competing objectives. However, these objectives are often in different units and/or scales, which can make it challenging for practitioners to express numerical preferences over objectives in their native units. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning that enables setting desired preferences for objectives in a scale-invariant way. We propose to learn an action distribution for each objective, and we use supervised learning to fit a parametric policy to a combination of these distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging high-dimensional real and simulated robotics tasks, and show that setting different preferences in our framework allows us to trace out the space of nondominated solutions. 

Title: Visual Servoing from Deep Neural Networks
Abstract:  We present a deep neural network-based method to perform high-precision, robust and real-time 6 DOF visual servoing. The paper describes how to create a dataset simulating various perturbations (occlusions and lighting conditions) from a single real-world image of the scene. A convolutional neural network is fine-tuned using this dataset to estimate the relative pose between two images of the same scene. The output of the network is then employed in a visual servoing control scheme. The method converges robustly even in difficult real-world settings with strong lighting variations and occlusions.A positioning error of less than one millimeter is obtained in experiments with a 6 DOF robot. 

Title: Curious Hierarchical Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Hierarchical abstraction and curiosity-driven exploration are two common paradigms in current reinforcement learning approaches to break down difficult problems into a sequence of simpler ones and to overcome reward sparsity. However, there is a lack of approaches that combine these paradigms, and it is currently unknown whether curiosity also helps to perform the hierarchical abstraction. As a novelty and scientific contribution, we tackle this issue and develop a method that combines hierarchical reinforcement learning with curiosity. Herein, we extend a contemporary hierarchical actor-critic approach with a forward model to develop a hierarchical notion of curiosity. We demonstrate in several continuous-space environments that curiosity can more than double the learning performance and success rates for most of the investigated benchmarking problems. We also provide our source code and a supplementary video. 

Title: Learning Complex Dexterous Manipulation with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Demonstrations
Abstract:  Dexterous multi-fingered hands are extremely versatile and provide a generic way to perform a multitude of tasks in human-centric environments. However, effectively controlling them remains challenging due to their high dimensionality and large number of potential contacts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a model-agnostic approach to control complex dynamical systems, but has not been shown to scale to high-dimensional dexterous manipulation. Furthermore, deployment of DRL on physical systems remains challenging due to sample inefficiency. Consequently, the success of DRL in robotics has thus far been limited to simpler manipulators and tasks. In this work, we show that model-free DRL can effectively scale up to complex manipulation tasks with a high-dimensional 24-DoF hand, and solve them from scratch in simulated experiments. Furthermore, with the use of a small number of human demonstrations, the sample complexity can be significantly reduced, which enables learning with sample sizes equivalent to a few hours of robot experience. The use of demonstrations result in policies that exhibit very natural movements and, surprisingly, are also substantially more robust. 

Title: Neural SLAM: Learning to Explore with External Memory
Abstract:  We present an approach for agents to learn representations of a global map from sensor data, to aid their exploration in new environments. To achieve this, we embed procedures mimicking that of traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) into the soft attention based addressing of external memory architectures, in which the external memory acts as an internal representation of the environment. This structure encourages the evolution of SLAM-like behaviors inside a completely differentiable deep neural network. We show that this approach can help reinforcement learning agents to successfully explore new environments where long-term memory is essential. We validate our approach in both challenging grid-world environments and preliminary Gazebo experiments. A video of our experiments can be found at: https://goo.gl/G2Vu5y. 

Title: State Representation Learning from Demonstration
Abstract:  In a context where several policies can be observed as black boxes on different instances of a control task, we propose a method to derive a state representation that can be relied on to reproduce any of the observed policies. We do so via imitation learning on a multi-head neural network consisting of a first part that outputs a common state representation and then one head per policy to imitate. If the demonstrations contain enough diversity, the state representation is general and can be transferred to learn new instances of the task. We present a proof of concept with experimental results on a simulated 2D robotic arm performing a reaching task, with noisy image inputs containing a distractor, and show that the state representations learned provide a greater speed up to end-to-end reinforcement learning on new instances of the task than with other classical representations. 

Title: Proximodistal Exploration in Motor Learning as an Emergent Property of Optimization
Abstract:  To harness the complexity of their high-dimensional bodies during sensorimotor development, infants are guided by patterns of freezing and freeing of degrees of freedom. For instance, when learning to reach, infants free the degrees of freedom in their arm proximodistally, i.e. from joints that are closer to the body to those that are more distant. Here, we formulate and study computationally the hypothesis that such patterns can emerge spontaneously as the result of a family of stochastic optimization processes (evolution strategies with covariance-matrix adaptation), without an innate encoding of a maturational schedule. In particular, we present simulated experiments with an arm where a computational learner progressively acquires reaching skills through adaptive exploration, and we show that a proximodistal organization appears spontaneously, which we denote PDFF (ProximoDistal Freezing and Freeing of degrees of freedom). We also compare this emergent organization between different arm morphologies -- from human-like to quite unnatural ones -- to study the effect of different kinematic structures on the emergence of PDFF. Keywords: human motor learning; proximo-distal exploration; stochastic optimization; modelling; evolution strategies; cross-entropy methods; policy search; morphology.} 

Title: Combining Physical Simulators and Object-Based Networks for Control
Abstract:  Physics engines play an important role in robot planning and control; however, many real-world control problems involve complex contact dynamics that cannot be characterized analytically. Most physics engines therefore employ . approximations that lead to a loss in precision. In this paper, we propose a hybrid dynamics model, simulator-augmented interaction networks (SAIN), combining a physics engine with an object-based neural network for dynamics modeling. Compared with existing models that are purely analytical or purely data-driven, our hybrid model captures the dynamics of interacting objects in a more accurate and data-efficient manner.Experiments both in simulation and on a real robot suggest that it also leads to better performance when used in complex control tasks. Finally, we show that our model generalizes to novel environments with varying object shapes and materials. 

Title: Towards Intelligent Pick and Place Assembly of Individualized Products Using Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Individualized manufacturing is becoming an important approach as a means to fulfill increasingly diverse and specific consumer requirements and expectations. While there are various solutions to the implementation of the manufacturing process, such as additive manufacturing, the subsequent automated assembly remains a challenging task. As an approach to this problem, we aim to teach a collaborative robot to successfully perform pick and place tasks by implementing reinforcement learning. For the assembly of an individualized product in a constantly changing manufacturing environment, the simulated geometric and dynamic parameters will be varied. Using reinforcement learning algorithms capable of meta-learning, the tasks will first be trained in simulation. They will then be performed in a real-world environment where new factors are introduced that were not simulated in training to confirm the robustness of the algorithms. The robot will gain its input data from tactile sensors, area scan cameras, and 3D cameras used to generate heightmaps of the environment and the objects. The selection of machine learning algorithms and hardware components as well as further research questions to realize the outlined production scenario are the results of the presented work. 

Title: Imitation Learning as $f$-Divergence Minimization
Abstract:  We address the problem of imitation learning with multi-modal demonstrations. Instead of attempting to learn all modes, we argue that in many tasks it is sufficient to imitate any one of them. We show that the state-of-the-art methods such as GAIL and behavior cloning, due to their choice of loss function, often incorrectly interpolate between such modes. Our key insight is to minimize the right divergence between the learner and the expert state-action distributions, namely the reverse KL divergence or I-projection. We propose a general imitation learning framework for estimating and minimizing any f-Divergence. By plugging in different divergences, we are able to recover existing algorithms such as Behavior Cloning (Kullback-Leibler), GAIL (Jensen Shannon) and Dagger (Total Variation). Empirical results show that our approximate I-projection technique is able to imitate multi-modal behaviors more reliably than GAIL and behavior cloning. 

Title: Closing the Sim-to-Real Loop: Adapting Simulation Randomization with Real World Experience
Abstract:  We consider the problem of transferring policies to the real world by training on a distribution of simulated scenarios. Rather than manually tuning the randomization of simulations, we adapt the simulation parameter distribution using a few real world roll-outs interleaved with policy training. In doing so, we are able to change the distribution of simulations to improve the policy transfer by matching the policy behavior in simulation and the real world. We show that policies trained with our method are able to reliably transfer to different robots in two real world tasks: swing-peg-in-hole and opening a cabinet drawer.

Title: HeatNet: Bridging the Day-Night Domain Gap in Semantic Segmentation with Thermal Images
Abstract:  The majority of learning-based semantic segmentation methods are optimized for daytime scenarios and favorable lighting conditions. Real-world driving scenarios, however, entail adverse environmental conditions such as nighttime illumination or glare which remain a challenge for existing approaches. In this work, we propose a multimodal semantic segmentation model that can be applied during daytime and nighttime. To this end, besides RGB images, we leverage thermal images, making our network significantly more robust. We avoid the expensive annotation of nighttime images by leveraging an existing daytime RGB-dataset and propose a teacher-student training approach that transfers the dataset's knowledge to the nighttime domain. We further employ a domain adaptation method to align the learned feature spaces across the domains and propose a novel two-stage training scheme. Furthermore, due to a lack of thermal data for autonomous driving, we present a new dataset comprising over 20,000 time-synchronized and aligned RGB-thermal image pairs. In this context, we also present a novel target-less calibration method that allows for automatic robust extrinsic and intrinsic thermal camera calibration. Among others, we employ our new dataset to show state-of-the-art results for nighttime semantic segmentation. 

Title: A Survey of Recent Scalability Improvements for Semidefinite Programming with Applications in Machine Learning, Control, and Robotics
Abstract:  Historically, scalability has been a major challenge to the successful application of semidefinite programming in fields such as machine learning, control, and robotics. In this paper, we survey recent approaches for addressing this challenge including (i) approaches for exploiting structure (e.g., sparsity and symmetry) in a problem, (ii) approaches that produce low-rank approximate solutions to semidefinite programs, (iii) more scalable algorithms that rely on augmented Lagrangian techniques and the alternating direction method of multipliers, and (iv) approaches that trade off scalability with conservatism (e.g., by approximating semidefinite programs with linear and second-order cone programs). For each class of approaches we provide a high-level exposition, an entry-point to the corresponding literature, and examples drawn from machine learning, control, or robotics. We also present a list of software packages that implement many of the techniques discussed in the paper. Our hope is that this paper will serve as a gateway to the rich and exciting literature on scalable semidefinite programming for both theorists and practitioners. 

Title: SalientDSO: Bringing Attention to Direct Sparse Odometry
Abstract:  Although cluttered indoor scenes have a lot of useful high-level semantic information which can be used for mapping and localization, most Visual Odometry (VO) algorithms rely on the usage of geometric features such as points, lines and planes. Lately, driven by this idea, the joint optimization of semantic labels and obtaining odometry has gained popularity in the robotics community. The joint optimization is good for accurate results but is generally very slow. At the same time, in the vision community, direct and sparse approaches for VO have stricken the right balance between speed and accuracy. We merge the successes of these two communities and present a way to incorporate semantic information in the form of visual saliency to Direct Sparse Odometry - a highly successful direct sparse VO algorithm. We also present a framework to filter the visual saliency based on scene parsing. Our framework, SalientDSO, relies on the widely successful deep learning based approaches for visual saliency and scene parsing which drives the feature selection for obtaining highly-accurate and robust VO even in the presence of as few as 40 point features per frame. We provide extensive quantitative evaluation of SalientDSO on the ICL-NUIM and TUM monoVO datasets and show that we outperform DSO and ORB-SLAM - two very popular state-of-the-art approaches in the literature. We also collect and publicly release a CVL-UMD dataset which contains two indoor cluttered sequences on which we show qualitative evaluations. To our knowledge this is the first paper to use visual saliency and scene parsing to drive the feature selection in direct VO. 

Title: Look, Listen, and Act: Towards Audio-Visual Embodied Navigation
Abstract:  A crucial ability of mobile intelligent agents is to integrate the evidence from multiple sensory inputs in an environment and to make a sequence of actions to reach their goals. In this paper, we attempt to approach the problem of Audio-Visual Embodied Navigation, the task of planning the shortest path from a random starting location in a scene to the sound source in an indoor environment, given only raw egocentric visual and audio sensory data. To accomplish this task, the agent is required to learn from various modalities, i.e. relating the audio signal to the visual environment. Here we describe an approach to audio-visual embodied navigation that takes advantage of both visual and audio pieces of evidence. Our solution is based on three key ideas: a visual perception mapper module that constructs its spatial memory of the environment, a sound perception module that infers the relative location of the sound source from the agent, and a dynamic path planner that plans a sequence of actions based on the audio-visual observations and the spatial memory of the environment to navigate toward the goal. Experimental results on a newly collected Visual-Audio-Room dataset using the simulated multi-modal environment demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over several competitive baselines. 

Title: Deep Active Localization
Abstract:  Active localization is the problem of generating robot actions that allow it to maximally disambiguate its pose within a reference map. Traditional approaches to this use an information-theoretic criterion for action selection and hand-crafted perceptual models. In this work we propose an end-to-end differentiable method for learning to take informative actions that is trainable entirely in simulation and then transferable to real robot hardware with zero refinement. The system is composed of two modules: a convolutional neural network for perception, and a deep reinforcement learned planning module. We introduce a multi-scale approach to the learned perceptual model since the accuracy needed to perform action selection with reinforcement learning is much less than the accuracy needed for robot control. We demonstrate that the resulting system outperforms using the traditional approach for either perception or planning. We also demonstrate our approaches robustness to different map configurations and other nuisance parameters through the use of domain randomization in training. The code is also compatible with the OpenAI gym framework, as well as the Gazebo simulator. 

Title: ST-MNIST -- The Spiking Tactile MNIST Neuromorphic Dataset
Abstract:  Tactile sensing is an essential modality for smart robots as it enables them to interact flexibly with physical objects in their environment. Recent advancements in electronic skins have led to the development of data-driven machine learning methods that exploit this important sensory modality. However, current datasets used to train such algorithms are limited to standard synchronous tactile sensors. There is a dearth of neuromorphic event-based tactile datasets, principally due to the scarcity of large-scale event-based tactile sensors. Having such datasets is crucial for the development and evaluation of new algorithms that process spatio-temporal event-based data. For example, evaluating spiking neural networks on conventional frame-based datasets is considered sub-optimal. Here, we debut a novel neuromorphic Spiking Tactile MNIST (ST-MNIST) dataset, which comprises handwritten digits obtained by human participants writing on a neuromorphic tactile sensor array. We also describe an initial effort to evaluate our ST-MNIST dataset using existing artificial and spiking neural network models. The classification accuracies provided herein can serve as performance benchmarks for future work. We anticipate that our ST-MNIST dataset will be of interest and useful to the neuromorphic and robotics research communities. 

Title: Sample Efficient Optimization for Learning Controllers for Bipedal Locomotion
Abstract:  Learning policies for bipedal locomotion can be difficult, as experiments are expensive and simulation does not usually transfer well to hardware. To counter this, we need al- gorithms that are sample efficient and inherently safe. Bayesian Optimization is a powerful sample-efficient tool for optimizing non-convex black-box functions. However, its performance can degrade in higher dimensions. We develop a distance metric for bipedal locomotion that enhances the sample-efficiency of Bayesian Optimization and use it to train a 16 dimensional neuromuscular model for planar walking. This distance metric reflects some basic gait features of healthy walking and helps us quickly eliminate a majority of unstable controllers. With our approach we can learn policies for walking in less than 100 trials for a range of challenging settings. In simulation, we show results on two different costs and on various terrains including rough ground and ramps, sloping upwards and downwards. We also perturb our models with unknown inertial disturbances analogous with differences between simulation and hardware. These results are promising, as they indicate that this method can potentially be used to learn control policies on hardware. 

Title: Learning and Inferring a Driver's Braking Action in Car-Following Scenarios
Abstract:  Accurately predicting and inferring a driver's decision to brake is critical for designing warning systems and avoiding collisions. In this paper we focus on predicting a driver's intent to brake in car-following scenarios from a perception-decision-action perspective according to his/her driving history. A learning-based inference method, using onboard data from CAN-Bus, radar and cameras as explanatory variables, is introduced to infer drivers' braking decisions by combining a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with a hidden Markov model (HMM). The GMM is used to model stochastic relationships among variables, while the HMM is applied to infer drivers' braking actions based on the GMM. Real-case driving data from 49 drivers (more than three years' driving data per driver on average) have been collected from the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment database. We compare the GMM-HMM method to a support vector machine (SVM) method and an SVM-Bayesian filtering method. The experimental results are evaluated by employing three performance metrics: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity. The comparison results show that the GMM-HMM obtains the best performance, with an accuracy of 90%, sensitivity of 84%, and specificity of 97%. Thus, we believe that this method has great potential for real-world active safety systems. 

Title: CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator
Abstract:  We introduce CARLA, an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous urban driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions. We use CARLA to study the performance of three approaches to autonomous driving: a classic modular pipeline, an end-to-end model trained via imitation learning, and an end-to-end model trained via reinforcement learning. The approaches are evaluated in controlled scenarios of increasing difficulty, and their performance is examined via metrics provided by CARLA, illustrating the platform's utility for autonomous driving research.

Title: Forecasting Social Navigation in Crowded Complex Scenes
Abstract:  When humans navigate a crowed space such as a university campus or the sidewalks of a busy street, they follow common sense rules based on social etiquette. In this paper, we argue that in order to enable the design of new algorithms that can take fully advantage of these rules to better solve tasks such as target tracking or trajectory forecasting, we need to have access to better data in the first place. To that end, we contribute the very first large scale dataset (to the best of our knowledge) that collects images and videos of various types of targets (not just pedestrians, but also bikers, skateboarders, cars, buses, golf carts) that navigate in a real-world outdoor environment such as a university campus. We present an extensive evaluation where different methods for trajectory forecasting are evaluated and compared. Moreover, we present a new algorithm for trajectory prediction that exploits the complexity of our new dataset and allows to: i) incorporate inter-class interactions into trajectory prediction models (e.g, pedestrian vs bike) as opposed to just intra-class interactions (e.g., pedestrian vs pedestrian); ii) model the degree to which the social forces are regulating an interaction. We call the latter "social sensitivity"and it captures the sensitivity to which a target is responding to a certain interaction. An extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our novel approach. 

Title: Autonomous task planning and situation awareness in robotic surgery
Abstract:  The use of robots in minimally invasive surgery has improved the quality of standard surgical procedures. So far, only the automation of simple surgical actions has been investigated by researchers, while the execution of structured tasks requiring reasoning on the environment and the choice among multiple actions is still managed by human surgeons. In this paper, we propose a framework to implement surgical task automation. The framework consists of a task-level reasoning module based on answer set programming, a low-level motion planning module based on dynamic movement primitives, and a situation awareness module. The logic-based reasoning module generates explainable plans and is able to recover from failure conditions, which are identified and explained by the situation awareness module interfacing to a human supervisor, for enhanced safety. Dynamic Movement Primitives allow to replicate the dexterity of surgeons and to adapt to obstacles and changes in the environment. The framework is validated on different versions of the standard surgical training peg-and-ring task. 

Title: A Perceived Environment Design using a Multi-Modal Variational Autoencoder for learning Active-Sensing
Abstract:  This contribution comprises the interplay between a multi-modal variational autoencoder and an environment to a perceived environment, on which an agent can act. Furthermore, we conclude our work with a comparison to curiosity-driven learning. 

Title: Contextual Imagined Goals for Self-Supervised Robotic Learning
Abstract:  While reinforcement learning provides an appealing formalism for learning individual skills, a general-purpose robotic system must be able to master an extensive repertoire of behaviors. Instead of learning a large collection of skills individually, can we instead enable a robot to propose and practice its own behaviors automatically, learning about the affordances and behaviors that it can perform in its environment, such that it can then repurpose this knowledge once a new task is commanded by the user? In this paper, we study this question in the context of self-supervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. A central challenge in this learning regime is the problem of goal setting: in order to practice useful skills, the robot must be able to autonomously set goals that are feasible but diverse. When the robot's environment and available objects vary, as they do in most open-world settings, the robot must propose to itself only those goals that it can accomplish in its present setting with the objects that are at hand. Previous work only studies self-supervised goal-conditioned RL in a single-environment setting, where goal proposals come from the robot's past experience or a generative model are sufficient. In more diverse settings, this frequently leads to impossible goals and, as we show experimentally, prevents effective learning. We propose a conditional goal-setting model that aims to propose goals that are feasible from the robot's current state. We demonstrate that this enables self-supervised goal-conditioned off-policy learning with raw image observations in the real world, enabling a robot to manipulate a variety of objects and generalize to new objects that were not seen during training. 

Title: Shapechanger: Environments for Transfer Learning
Abstract:  We present Shapechanger, a library for transfer reinforcement learning specifically designed for robotic tasks. We consider three types of knowledge transfer---from simulation to simulation, from simulation to real, and from real to real---and a wide range of tasks with continuous states and actions. Shapechanger is under active development and open-sourced at: https://github.com/seba-1511/shapechanger/. 

Title: Can a Robot Become a Movie Director? Learning Artistic Principles for Aerial Cinematography
Abstract:  Aerial filming is constantly gaining importance due to the recent advances in drone technology. It invites many intriguing, unsolved problems at the intersection of aesthetical and scientific challenges. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning agent which supervises motion planning of a filming drone by making desirable shot mode selections based on aesthetical values of video shots. Unlike most of the current state-of-the-art approaches that require explicit guidance by a human expert, our drone learns how to make favorable viewpoint selections by experience. We propose a learning scheme that exploits aesthetical features of retrospective shots in order to extract a desirable policy for better prospective shots. We train our agent in realistic AirSim simulations using both a hand-crafted reward function as well as reward from direct human input. We then deploy the same agent on a real DJI M210 drone in order to test the generalization capability of our approach to real world conditions. To evaluate the success of our approach in the end, we conduct a comprehensive user study in which participants rate the shot quality of our methods. Videos of the system in action can be seen at https://youtu.be/qmVw6mfyEmw. 

Title: One-Shot Learning of Manipulation Skills with Online Dynamics Adaptation and Neural Network Priors
Abstract:  One of the key challenges in applying reinforcement learning to complex robotic control tasks is the need to gather large amounts of experience in order to find an effective policy for the task at hand. Model-based reinforcement learning can achieve good sample efficiency, but requires the ability to learn a model of the dynamics that is good enough to learn an effective policy. In this work, we develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that combines prior knowledge from previous tasks with online adaptation of the dynamics model. These two ingredients enable highly sample-efficient learning even in regimes where estimating the true dynamics is very difficult, since the online model adaptation allows the method to locally compensate for unmodeled variation in the dynamics. We encode the prior experience into a neural network dynamics model, adapt it online by progressively refitting a local linear model of the dynamics, and use model predictive control to plan under these dynamics. Our experimental results show that this approach can be used to solve a variety of complex robotic manipulation tasks in just a single attempt, using prior data from other manipulation behaviors. 

Title: Learning to predict metal deformations in hot-rolling processes
Abstract:  Hot-rolling is a metal forming process that produces a workpiece with a desired target cross-section from an input workpiece through a sequence of plastic deformations; each deformation is generated by a stand composed of opposing rolls with a specific geometry. In current practice, the rolling sequence (i.e., the sequence of stands and the geometry of their rolls) needed to achieve a given final cross-section is designed by experts based on previous experience, and iteratively refined in a costly trial-and-error process. Finite Element Method simulations are increasingly adopted to make this process more efficient and to test potential rolling sequences, achieving good accuracy at the cost of long simulation times, limiting the practical use of the approach. We propose a supervised learning approach to predict the deformation of a given workpiece by a set of rolls with a given geometry; the model is trained on a large dataset of procedurally-generated FEM simulations, which we publish as supplementary material. The resulting predictor is four orders of magnitude faster than simulations, and yields an average Jaccard Similarity Index of 0.972 (against ground truth from simulations) and 0.925 (against real-world measured deformations); we additionally report preliminary results on using the predictor for automatic planning of rolling sequences. 

Title: LoST? Appearance-Invariant Place Recognition for Opposite Viewpoints using Visual Semantics
Abstract:  Human visual scene understanding is so remarkable that we are able to recognize a revisited place when entering it from the opposite direction it was first visited, even in the presence of extreme variations in appearance. This capability is especially apparent during driving: a human driver can recognize where they are when travelling in the reverse direction along a route for the first time, without having to turn back and look. The difficulty of this problem exceeds any addressed in past appearance- and viewpoint-invariant visual place recognition (VPR) research, in part because large parts of the scene are not commonly observable from opposite directions. Consequently, as shown in this paper, the precision-recall performance of current state-of-the-art viewpoint- and appearance-invariant VPR techniques is orders of magnitude below what would be usable in a closed-loop system. Current engineered solutions predominantly rely on panoramic camera or LIDAR sensing setups; an eminently suitable engineering solution but one that is clearly very different to how humans navigate, which also has implications for how naturally humans could interact and communicate with the navigation system. In this paper we develop a suite of novel semantic- and appearance-based techniques to enable for the first time high performance place recognition in this challenging scenario. We first propose a novel Local Semantic Tensor (LoST) descriptor of images using the convolutional feature maps from a state-of-the-art dense semantic segmentation network. Then, to verify the spatial semantic arrangement of the top matching candidates, we develop a novel approach for mining semantically-salient keypoint correspondences. 

Title: DEDUCE: Diverse scEne Detection methods in Unseen Challenging Environments
Abstract:  In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of service robots deployed for aiding people in their daily activities. Unfortunately, most of these robots require human input for training in order to do tasks in indoor environments. Successful domestic navigation often requires access to semantic information about the environment, which can be learned without human guidance. In this paper, we propose a set of DEDUCE - Diverse scEne Detection methods in Unseen Challenging Environments algorithms which incorporate deep fusion models derived from scene recognition systems and object detectors. The five methods described here have been evaluated on several popular recent image datasets, as well as real-world videos acquired through multiple mobile platforms. The final results show an improvement over the existing state-of-the-art visual place recognition systems. 

Title: The iCub multisensor datasets for robot and computer vision applications
Abstract:  This document presents novel datasets, constructed by employing the iCub robot equipped with an additional depth sensor and color camera. We used the robot to acquire color and depth information for 210 objects in different acquisition scenarios. At this end, the results were large scale datasets for robot and computer vision applications: object representation, object recognition and classification, and action recognition. 

Title: Overcoming Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Demonstrations
Abstract:  Exploration in environments with sparse rewards has been a persistent problem in reinforcement learning (RL). Many tasks are natural to specify with a sparse reward, and manually shaping a reward function can result in suboptimal performance. However, finding a non-zero reward is exponentially more difficult with increasing task horizon or action dimensionality. This puts many real-world tasks out of practical reach of RL methods. In this work, we use demonstrations to overcome the exploration problem and successfully learn to perform long-horizon, multi-step robotics tasks with continuous control such as stacking blocks with a robot arm. Our method, which builds on top of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients and Hindsight Experience Replay, provides an order of magnitude of speedup over RL on simulated robotics tasks. It is simple to implement and makes only the additional assumption that we can collect a small set of demonstrations. Furthermore, our method is able to solve tasks not solvable by either RL or behavior cloning alone, and often ends up outperforming the demonstrator policy. 

Title: VRUNet: Multi-Task Learning Model for Intent Prediction of Vulnerable Road Users
Abstract:  Advanced perception and path planning are at the core for any self-driving vehicle. Autonomous vehicles need to understand the scene and intentions of other road users for safe motion planning. For urban use cases it is very important to perceive and predict the intentions of pedestrians, cyclists, scooters, etc., classified as vulnerable road users (VRU). Intent is a combination of pedestrian activities and long term trajectories defining their future motion. In this paper we propose a multi-task learning model to predict pedestrian actions, crossing intent and forecast their future path from video sequences. We have trained the model on naturalistic driving open-source JAAD dataset, which is rich in behavioral annotations and real world scenarios. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance on JAAD dataset and how we can benefit from jointly learning and predicting actions and trajectories using 2D human pose features and scene context. 

Title: Active Learning within Constrained Environments through Imitation of an Expert Questioner
Abstract:  Active learning agents typically employ a query selection algorithm which solely considers the agent's learning objectives. However, this may be insufficient in more realistic human domains. This work uses imitation learning to enable an agent in a constrained environment to concurrently reason about both its internal learning goals and environmental constraints externally imposed, all within its objective function. Experiments are conducted on a concept learning task to test generalization of the proposed algorithm to different environmental conditions and analyze how time and resource constraints impact efficacy of solving the learning problem. Our findings show the environmentally-aware learning agent is able to statistically outperform all other active learners explored under most of the constrained conditions. A key implication is adaptation for active learning agents to more realistic human environments, where constraints are often externally imposed on the learner. 

Title: Weakly-Supervised Reinforcement Learning for Controllable Behavior
Abstract:  Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for learning to take actions to solve tasks. However, in many settings, an agent must winnow down the inconceivably large space of all possible tasks to the single task that it is currently being asked to solve. Can we instead constrain the space of tasks to those that are semantically meaningful? In this work, we introduce a framework for using weak supervision to automatically disentangle this semantically meaningful subspace of tasks from the enormous space of nonsensical "chaff" tasks. We show that this learned subspace enables efficient exploration and provides a representation that captures distance between states. On a variety of challenging, vision-based continuous control problems, our approach leads to substantial performance gains, particularly as the complexity of the environment grows. 

Title: Towards Adaptive Benthic Habitat Mapping
Abstract:  Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly being used to support scientific research and monitoring studies. One such application is in benthic habitat mapping where these vehicles collect seafloor imagery that complements broadscale bathymetric data collected using sonar. Using these two data sources, the relationship between remotely-sensed acoustic data and the sampled imagery can be learned, creating a habitat model. As the areas to be mapped are often very large and AUV systems collecting seafloor imagery can only sample from a small portion of the survey area, the information gathered should be maximised for each deployment. This paper illustrates how the habitat models themselves can be used to plan more efficient AUV surveys by identifying where to collect further samples in order to most improve the habitat model. A Bayesian neural network is used to predict visually-derived habitat classes when given broad-scale bathymetric data. This network can also estimate the uncertainty associated with a prediction, which can be deconstructed into its aleatoric (data) and epistemic (model) components. We demonstrate how these structured uncertainty estimates can be utilised to improve the model with fewer samples. Such adaptive approaches to benthic surveys have the potential to reduce costs by prioritizing further sampling efforts. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using data collected by an AUV on offshore reefs in Tasmania, Australia. 

Title: GLADAS: Gesture Learning for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
Abstract:  Human-computer interaction (HCI) is crucial for the safety of lives as autonomous vehicles (AVs) become commonplace. Yet, little effort has been put toward ensuring that AVs understand humans on the road. In this paper, we present GLADAS, a simulator-based research platform designed to teach AVs to understand pedestrian hand gestures. GLADAS supports the training, testing, and validation of deep learning-based self-driving car gesture recognition systems. We focus on gestures as they are a primordial (i.e, natural and common) way to interact with cars. To the best of our knowledge, GLADAS is the first system of its kind designed to provide an infrastructure for further research into human-AV interaction. We also develop a hand gesture recognition algorithm for self-driving cars, using GLADAS to evaluate its performance. Our results show that an AV understands human gestures 85.91% of the time, reinforcing the need for further research into human-AV interaction. 

Title: DA-RNN: Semantic Mapping with Data Associated Recurrent Neural Networks
Abstract:  3D scene understanding is important for robots to interact with the 3D world in a meaningful way. Most previous works on 3D scene understanding focus on recognizing geometrical or semantic properties of the scene independently. In this work, we introduce Data Associated Recurrent Neural Networks (DA-RNNs), a novel framework for joint 3D scene mapping and semantic labeling. DA-RNNs use a new recurrent neural network architecture for semantic labeling on RGB-D videos. The output of the network is integrated with mapping techniques such as KinectFusion in order to inject semantic information into the reconstructed 3D scene. Experiments conducted on a real world dataset and a synthetic dataset with RGB-D videos demonstrate the ability of our method in semantic 3D scene mapping. 

Title: 3D tracking of water hazards with polarized stereo cameras
Abstract:  Current self-driving car systems operate well in sunny weather but struggle in adverse conditions. One of the most commonly encountered adverse conditions involves water on the road caused by rain, sleet, melting snow or flooding. While some advances have been made in using conventional RGB camera and LIDAR technology for detecting water hazards, other sources of information such as polarization offer a promising and potentially superior approach to this problem in terms of performance and cost. In this paper, we present a novel stereo-polarization system for detecting and tracking water hazards based on polarization and color variation of reflected light, with consideration of the effect of polarized light from sky as function of reflection and azimuth angles. To evaluate this system, we present a new large `water on road' datasets spanning approximately 2 km of driving in various on-road and off-road conditions and demonstrate for the first time reliable water detection and tracking over a wide range of realistic car driving water conditions using polarized vision as the primary sensing modality. Our system successfully detects water hazards up to more than 100m. Finally, we discuss several interesting challenges and propose future research directions for further improving robust autonomous car perception in hazardous wet conditions using polarization sensors. 

Title: DronePose: Photorealistic UAV-Assistant Dataset Synthesis for 3D Pose Estimation via a Smooth Silhouette Loss
Abstract:  In this work we consider UAVs as cooperative agents supporting human users in their operations. In this context, the 3D localisation of the UAV assistant is an important task that can facilitate the exchange of spatial information between the user and the UAV. To address this in a data-driven manner, we design a data synthesis pipeline to create a realistic multimodal dataset that includes both the exocentric user view, and the egocentric UAV view. We then exploit the joint availability of photorealistic and synthesized inputs to train a single-shot monocular pose estimation model. During training we leverage differentiable rendering to supplement a state-of-the-art direct regression objective with a novel smooth silhouette loss. Our results demonstrate its qualitative and quantitative performance gains over traditional silhouette objectives. Our data and code are available at https://vcl3d.github.io/DronePose 

Title: Benchmarking Deep Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control
Abstract:  Recently, researchers have made significant progress combining the advances in deep learning for learning feature representations with reinforcement learning. Some notable examples include training agents to play Atari games based on raw pixel data and to acquire advanced manipulation skills using raw sensory inputs. However, it has been difficult to quantify progress in the domain of continuous control due to the lack of a commonly adopted benchmark. In this work, we present a benchmark suite of continuous control tasks, including classic tasks like cart-pole swing-up, tasks with very high state and action dimensionality such as 3D humanoid locomotion, tasks with partial observations, and tasks with hierarchical structure. We report novel findings based on the systematic evaluation of a range of implemented reinforcement learning algorithms. Both the benchmark and reference implementations are released at https://github.com/rllab/rllab in order to facilitate experimental reproducibility and to encourage adoption by other researchers. 

Title: BTEL: A Binary Tree Encoding Approach for Visual Localization
Abstract:  Visual localization algorithms have achieved significant improvements in performance thanks to recent advances in camera technology and vision-based techniques. However, there remains one critical caveat: all current approaches that are based on image retrieval currently scale at best linearly with the size of the environment with respect to both storage, and consequentially in most approaches, query time. This limitation severely curtails the capability of autonomous systems in a wide range of compute, power, storage, size, weight or cost constrained applications such as drones. In this work, we present a novel binary tree encoding approach for visual localization which can serve as an alternative for existing quantization and indexing techniques. The proposed tree structure allows us to derive a compressed training scheme that achieves sub-linearity in both required storage and inference time. The encoding memory can be easily configured to satisfy different storage constraints. Moreover, our approach is amenable to an optional sequence filtering mechanism to further improve the localization results, while maintaining the same amount of storage. Our system is entirely agnostic to the front-end descriptors, allowing it to be used on top of recent state-of-the-art image representations. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under limited storage constraints. 

Title: OpenBot: Turning Smartphones into Robots
Abstract:  Current robots are either expensive or make significant compromises on sensory richness, computational power, and communication capabilities. We propose to leverage smartphones to equip robots with extensive sensor suites, powerful computational abilities, state-of-the-art communication channels, and access to a thriving software ecosystem. We design a small electric vehicle that costs $50 and serves as a robot body for standard Android smartphones. We develop a software stack that allows smartphones to use this body for mobile operation and demonstrate that the system is sufficiently powerful to support advanced robotics workloads such as person following and real-time autonomous navigation in unstructured environments. Controlled experiments demonstrate that the presented approach is robust across different smartphones and robot bodies.

Title: Robot Navigation in Crowds by Graph Convolutional Networks with Attention Learned from Human Gaze
Abstract:  Safe and efficient crowd navigation for mobile robot is a crucial yet challenging task. Previous work has shown the power of deep reinforcement learning frameworks to train efficient policies. However, their performance deteriorates when the crowd size grows. We suggest that this can be addressed by enabling the network to identify and pay attention to the humans in the crowd that are most critical to navigation. We propose a novel network utilizing a graph representation to learn the policy. We first train a graph convolutional network based on human gaze data that accurately predicts human attention to different agents in the crowd. Then we incorporate the learned attention into a graph-based reinforcement learning architecture. The proposed attention mechanism enables the assignment of meaningful weightings to the neighbors of the robot, and has the additional benefit of interpretability. Experiments on real-world dense pedestrian datasets with various crowd sizes demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-art methods by 18.4% in task accomplishment and by 16.4% in time efficiency. 

Title: OpenSeqSLAM2.0: An Open Source Toolbox for Visual Place Recognition Under Changing Conditions
Abstract:  Visually recognising a traversed route - regardless of whether seen during the day or night, in clear or inclement conditions, or in summer or winter - is an important capability for navigating robots. Since SeqSLAM was introduced in 2012, a large body of work has followed exploring how robotic systems can use the algorithm to meet the challenges posed by navigation in changing environmental conditions. The following paper describes OpenSeqSLAM2.0, a fully open source toolbox for visual place recognition under changing conditions. Beyond the benefits of open access to the source code, OpenSeqSLAM2.0 provides a number of tools to facilitate exploration of the visual place recognition problem and interactive parameter tuning. Using the new open source platform, it is shown for the first time how comprehensive parameter characterisations provide new insights into many of the system components previously presented in ad hoc ways and provide users with a guide to what system component options should be used under what circumstances and why. 

Title: Scalable sim-to-real transfer of soft robot designs
Abstract:  The manual design of soft robots and their controllers is notoriously challenging, but it could be augmented---or, in some cases, entirely replaced---by automated design tools. Machine learning algorithms can automatically propose, test, and refine designs in simulation, and the most promising ones can then be manufactured in reality (sim2real). However, it is currently not known how to guarantee that behavior generated in simulation can be preserved when deployed in reality. Although many previous studies have devised training protocols that facilitate sim2real transfer of control polices, little to no work has investigated the simulation-reality gap as a function of morphology. This is due in part to an overall lack of tools capable of systematically designing and rapidly manufacturing robots. Here we introduce a low cost, open source, and modular soft robot design and construction kit, and use it to simulate, fabricate, and measure the simulation-reality gap of minimally complex yet soft, locomoting machines. We prove the scalability of this approach by transferring an order of magnitude more robot designs from simulation to reality than any other method. The kit and its instructions can be found here: https://github.com/skriegman/sim2real4designs 

Title: Analysing Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents Trained with Domain Randomisation
Abstract:  Deep reinforcement learning has the potential to train robots to perform complex tasks in the real world without requiring accurate models of the robot or its environment. A practical approach is to train agents in simulation, and then transfer them to the real world. One popular method for achieving transferability is to use domain randomisation, which involves randomly perturbing various aspects of a simulated environment in order to make trained agents robust to the reality gap. However, less work has gone into understanding such agents - which are deployed in the real world - beyond task performance. In this work we examine such agents, through qualitative and quantitative comparisons between agents trained with and without visual domain randomisation. We train agents for Fetch and Jaco robots on a visuomotor control task and evaluate how well they generalise using different testing conditions. Finally, we investigate the internals of the trained agents by using a suite of interpretability techniques. Our results show that the primary outcome of domain randomisation is more robust, entangled representations, accompanied with larger weights with greater spatial structure; moreover, the types of changes are heavily influenced by the task setup and presence of additional proprioceptive inputs. Additionally, we demonstrate that our domain randomised agents require higher sample complexity, can overfit and more heavily rely on recurrent processing. Furthermore, even with an improved saliency method introduced in this work, we show that qualitative studies may not always correspond with quantitative measures, necessitating the combination of inspection tools in order to provide sufficient insights into the behaviour of trained agents. 

Title: From semantics to execution: Integrating action planning with reinforcement learning for robotic causal problem-solving
Abstract:  Reinforcement learning is an appropriate and successful method to robustly perform low-level robot control under noisy conditions. Symbolic action planning is useful to resolve causal dependencies and to break a causally complex problem down into a sequence of simpler high-level actions. A problem with the integration of both approaches is that action planning is based on discrete high-level action- and state spaces, whereas reinforcement learning is usually driven by a continuous reward function. However, recent advances in reinforcement learning, specifically, universal value function approximators and hindsight experience replay, have focused on goal-independent methods based on sparse rewards. In this article, we build on these novel methods to facilitate the integration of action planning with reinforcement learning by exploiting the reward-sparsity as a bridge between the high-level and low-level state- and control spaces. As a result, we demonstrate that the integrated neuro-symbolic method is able to solve object manipulation problems that involve tool use and non-trivial causal dependencies under noisy conditions, exploiting both data and knowledge. 

Title: Augmenting Physical Simulators with Stochastic Neural Networks: Case Study of Planar Pushing and Bouncing
Abstract:  An efficient, generalizable physical simulator with universal uncertainty estimates has wide applications in robot state estimation, planning, and control. In this paper, we build such a simulator for two scenarios, planar pushing and ball bouncing, by augmenting an analytical rigid-body simulator with a neural network that learns to model uncertainty as residuals. Combining symbolic, deterministic simulators with learnable, stochastic neural nets provides us with expressiveness, efficiency, and generalizability simultaneously. Our model outperforms both purely analytical and purely learned simulators consistently on real, standard benchmarks. Compared with methods that model uncertainty using Gaussian processes, our model runs much faster, generalizes better to new object shapes, and is able to characterize the complex distribution of object trajectories. 

Title: Multi-Robot Informative Path Planning for Active Sensing of Environmental Phenomena: A Tale of Two Algorithms
Abstract:  A key problem of robotic environmental sensing and monitoring is that of active sensing: How can a team of robots plan the most informative observation paths to minimize the uncertainty in modeling and predicting an environmental phenomenon? This paper presents two principled approaches to efficient information-theoretic path planning based on entropy and mutual information criteria for in situ active sensing of an important broad class of widely-occurring environmental phenomena called anisotropic fields. Our proposed algorithms are novel in addressing a trade-off between active sensing performance and time efficiency. An important practical consequence is that our algorithms can exploit the spatial correlation structure of Gaussian process-based anisotropic fields to improve time efficiency while preserving near-optimal active sensing performance. We analyze the time complexity of our algorithms and prove analytically that they scale better than state-of-the-art algorithms with increasing planning horizon length. We provide theoretical guarantees on the active sensing performance of our algorithms for a class of exploration tasks called transect sampling, which, in particular, can be improved with longer planning time and/or lower spatial correlation along the transect. Empirical evaluation on real-world anisotropic field data shows that our algorithms can perform better or at least as well as the state-of-the-art algorithms while often incurring a few orders of magnitude less computational time, even when the field conditions are less favorable. 

Title: A Framework for Probabilistic Generic Traffic Scene Prediction
Abstract:  In a given scenario, simultaneously and accurately predicting every possible interaction of traffic participants is an important capability for autonomous vehicles. The majority of current researches focused on the prediction of an single entity without incorporating the environment information. Although some approaches aimed to predict multiple vehicles, they either predicted each vehicle independently with no considerations on possible interaction with surrounding entities or generated discretized joint motions which cannot be directly used in decision making and motion planning for autonomous vehicle. In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework that is able to jointly predict continuous motions for multiple interacting road participants under any driving scenarios and is capable of forecasting the duration of each interaction, which can enhance the prediction performance and efficiency. The proposed traffic scene prediction framework contains two hierarchical modules: the upper module and the lower module. The upper module forecasts the intention of the predicted vehicle, while the lower module predicts motions for interacting scene entities. An exemplar real-world scenario is used to implement and examine the proposed framework. 

Title: Learning Q-network for Active Information Acquisition
Abstract:  In this paper, we propose a novel Reinforcement Learning approach for solving the Active Information Acquisition problem, which requires an agent to choose a sequence of actions in order to acquire information about a process of interest using on-board sensors. The classic challenges in the information acquisition problem are the dependence of a planning algorithm on known models and the difficulty of computing information-theoretic cost functions over arbitrary distributions. In contrast, the proposed framework of reinforcement learning does not require any knowledge on models and alleviates the problems during an extended training stage. It results in policies that are efficient to execute online and applicable for real-time control of robotic systems. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art planning methods are typically restricted to short horizons, which may become problematic with local minima. Reinforcement learning naturally handles the issue of planning horizon in information problems as it maximizes a discounted sum of rewards over a long finite or infinite time horizon. We discuss the potential benefits of the proposed framework and compare the performance of the novel algorithm to an existing information acquisition method for multi-target tracking scenarios. 

Title: Guided Feature Selection for Deep Visual Odometry
Abstract:  We present a novel end-to-end visual odometry architecture with guided feature selection based on deep convolutional recurrent neural networks. Different from current monocular visual odometry methods, our approach is established on the intuition that features contribute discriminately to different motion patterns. Specifically, we propose a dual-branch recurrent network to learn the rotation and translation separately by leveraging current Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature representation and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for image sequence reasoning. To enhance the ability of feature selection, we further introduce an effective context-aware guidance mechanism to force each branch to distill related information for specific motion pattern explicitly. Experiments demonstrate that on the prevalent KITTI and ICL_NUIM benchmarks, our method outperforms current state-of-the-art model- and learning-based methods for both decoupled and joint camera pose recovery. 

Title: Tree Morphology for Phenotyping from Semantics-Based Mapping in Orchard Environments
Abstract:  Measuring tree morphology for phenotyping is an essential but labor-intensive activity in horticulture. Researchers often rely on manual measurements which may not be accurate for example when measuring tree volume. Recent approaches on automating the measurement process rely on LIDAR measurements coupled with high-accuracy GPS. Usually each side of a row is reconstructed independently and then merged using GPS information. Such approaches have two disadvantages: (1) they rely on specialized and expensive equipment, and (2) since the reconstruction process does not simultaneously use information from both sides, side reconstructions may not be accurate. We also show that standard loop closure methods do not necessarily align tree trunks well. In this paper, we present a novel vision system that employs only an RGB-D camera to estimate morphological parameters. A semantics-based mapping algorithm merges the two-sides 3D models of tree rows, where integrated semantic information is obtained and refined by robust fitting algorithms. We focus on measuring tree height, canopy volume and trunk diameter from the optimized 3D model. Experiments conducted in real orchards quantitatively demonstrate the accuracy of our method. 

Title: Multi-Frame GAN: Image Enhancement for Stereo Visual Odometry in Low Light
Abstract:  We propose the concept of a multi-frame GAN (MFGAN) and demonstrate its potential as an image sequence enhancement for stereo visual odometry in low light conditions. We base our method on an invertible adversarial network to transfer the beneficial features of brightly illuminated scenes to the sequence in poor illumination without costly paired datasets. In order to preserve the coherent geometric cues for the translated sequence, we present a novel network architecture as well as a novel loss term combining temporal and stereo consistencies based on optical flow estimation. We demonstrate that the enhanced sequences improve the performance of state-of-the-art feature-based and direct stereo visual odometry methods on both synthetic and real datasets in challenging illumination. We also show that MFGAN outperforms other state-of-the-art image enhancement and style transfer methods by a large margin in terms of visual odometry. 

Title: Simultaneously Learning Vision and Feature-based Control Policies for Real-world Ball-in-a-Cup
Abstract:  We present a method for fast training of vision based control policies on real robots. The key idea behind our method is to perform multi-task Reinforcement Learning with auxiliary tasks that differ not only in the reward to be optimized but also in the state-space in which they operate. In particular, we allow auxiliary task policies to utilize task features that are available only at training-time. This allows for fast learning of auxiliary policies, which subsequently generate good data for training the main, vision-based control policies. This method can be seen as an extension of the Scheduled Auxiliary Control (SAC-X) framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by using both a simulated and real-world Ball-in-a-Cup game controlled by a robot arm. In simulation, our approach leads to significant learning speed-ups when compared to standard SAC-X. On the real robot we show that the task can be learned from-scratch, i.e., with no transfer from simulation and no imitation learning. Videos of our learned policies running on the real robot can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/rss-2019-sawyer-bic/. 

Title: Interaction Graphs for Object Importance Estimation in On-road Driving Videos
Abstract:  A vehicle driving along the road is surrounded by many objects, but only a small subset of them influence the driver's decisions and actions. Learning to estimate the importance of each object on the driver's real-time decision-making may help better understand human driving behavior and lead to more reliable autonomous driving systems. Solving this problem requires models that understand the interactions between the ego-vehicle and the surrounding objects. However, interactions among other objects in the scene can potentially also be very helpful, e.g., a pedestrian beginning to cross the road between the ego-vehicle and the car in front will make the car in front less important. We propose a novel framework for object importance estimation using an interaction graph, in which the features of each object node are updated by interacting with others through graph convolution. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with much less input and pre-processing. 

Title: GENESIS: Generative Scene Inference and Sampling with Object-Centric Latent Representations
Abstract:  Generative latent-variable models are emerging as promising tools in robotics and reinforcement learning. Yet, even though tasks in these domains typically involve distinct objects, most state-of-the-art generative models do not explicitly capture the compositional nature of visual scenes. Two recent exceptions, MONet and IODINE, decompose scenes into objects in an unsupervised fashion. Their underlying generative processes, however, do not account for component interactions. Hence, neither of them allows for principled sampling of novel scenes. Here we present GENESIS, the first object-centric generative model of 3D visual scenes capable of both decomposing and generating scenes by capturing relationships between scene components. GENESIS parameterises a spatial GMM over images which is decoded from a set of object-centric latent variables that are either inferred sequentially in an amortised fashion or sampled from an autoregressive prior. We train GENESIS on several publicly available datasets and evaluate its performance on scene generation, decomposition, and semi-supervised learning. 

Title: SeqLPD: Sequence Matching Enhanced Loop-Closure Detection Based on Large-Scale Point Cloud Description for Self-Driving Vehicles
Abstract:  Place recognition and loop-closure detection are main challenges in the localization, mapping and navigation tasks of self-driving vehicles. In this paper, we solve the loop-closure detection problem by incorporating the deep-learning based point cloud description method and the coarse-to-fine sequence matching strategy. More specifically, we propose a deep neural network to extract a global descriptor from the original large-scale 3D point cloud, then based on which, a typical place analysis approach is presented to investigate the feature space distribution of the global descriptors and select several super keyframes. Finally, a coarse-to-fine strategy, which includes a super keyframe based coarse matching stage and a local sequence matching stage, is presented to ensure the loop-closure detection accuracy and real-time performance simultaneously. Thanks to the sequence matching operation, the proposed approach obtains an improvement against the existing deep-learning based methods. Experiment results on a self-driving vehicle validate the effectiveness of the proposed loop-closure detection algorithm. 

Title: Learning scalable and transferable multi-robot/machine sequential assignment planning via graph embedding
Abstract:  Can the success of reinforcement learning methods for simple combinatorial optimization problems be extended to multi-robot sequential assignment planning? In addition to the challenge of achieving near-optimal performance in large problems, transferability to an unseen number of robots and tasks is another key challenge for real-world applications. In this paper, we suggest a method that achieves the first success in both challenges for robot/machine scheduling problems. Our method comprises of three components. First, we show a robot scheduling problem can be expressed as a random probabilistic graphical model (PGM). We develop a mean-field inference method for random PGM and use it for Q-function inference. Second, we show that transferability can be achieved by carefully designing two-step sequential encoding of problem state. Third, we resolve the computational scalability issue of fitted Q-iteration by suggesting a heuristic auction-based Q-iteration fitting method enabled by transferability we achieved. We apply our method to discrete-time, discrete space problems (Multi-Robot Reward Collection (MRRC)) and scalably achieve 97% optimality with transferability. This optimality is maintained under stochastic contexts. By extending our method to continuous time, continuous space formulation, we claim to be the first learning-based method with scalable performance among multi-machine scheduling problems; our method scalability achieves comparable performance to popular metaheuristics in Identical parallel machine scheduling (IPMS) problems. 

Title: Joint Inference of States, Robot Knowledge, and Human (False-)Beliefs
Abstract:  Aiming to understand how human (false-)belief--a core socio-cognitive ability--would affect human interactions with robots, this paper proposes to adopt a graphical model to unify the representation of object states, robot knowledge, and human (false-)beliefs. Specifically, a parse graph (pg) is learned from a single-view spatiotemporal parsing by aggregating various object states along the time; such a learned representation is accumulated as the robot's knowledge. An inference algorithm is derived to fuse individual pg from all robots across multi-views into a joint pg, which affords more effective reasoning and inference capability to overcome the errors originated from a single view. In the experiments, through the joint inference over pg-s, the system correctly recognizes human (false-)belief in various settings and achieves better cross-view accuracy on a challenging small object tracking dataset. 

Title: Event-based, 6-DOF Camera Tracking from Photometric Depth Maps
Abstract:  Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that output pixel-level brightness changes instead of standard intensity frames. These cameras do not suffer from motion blur and have a very high dynamic range, which enables them to provide reliable visual information during high-speed motions or in scenes characterized by high dynamic range. These features, along with a very low power consumption, make event cameras an ideal complement to standard cameras for VR/AR and video game applications. With these applications in mind, this paper tackles the problem of accurate, low-latency tracking of an event camera from an existing photometric depth map (i.e., intensity plus depth information) built via classic dense reconstruction pipelines. Our approach tracks the 6-DOF pose of the event camera upon the arrival of each event, thus virtually eliminating latency. We successfully evaluate the method in both indoor and outdoor scenes and show that---because of the technological advantages of the event camera---our pipeline works in scenes characterized by high-speed motion, which are still unaccessible to standard cameras. 

Title: Enhanced discrete particle swarm optimization path planning for UAV vision-based surface inspection
Abstract:  In built infrastructure monitoring, an efficient path planning algorithm is essential for robotic inspection of large surfaces using computer vision. In this work, we first formulate the inspection path planning problem as an extended travelling salesman problem (TSP) in which both the coverage and obstacle avoidance were taken into account. An enhanced discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm is then proposed to solve the TSP, with performance improvement by using deterministic initialization, random mutation, and edge exchange. Finally, we take advantage of parallel computing to implement the DPSO in a GPU-based framework so that the computation time can be significantly reduced while keeping the hardware requirement unchanged. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, experimental results are included for datasets obtained from UAV inspection of an office building and a bridge. 

Title: Interferobot: aligning an optical interferometer by a reinforcement learning agent
Abstract:  Limitations in acquiring training data restrict potential applications of deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods to the training of real-world robots. Here we train an RL agent to align a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which is an essential part of many optical experiments, based on images of interference fringes acquired by a monocular camera. The agent is trained in a simulated environment, without any hand-coded features or a priori information about the physics, and subsequently transferred to a physical interferometer. Thanks to a set of domain randomizations simulating uncertainties in physical measurements, the agent successfully aligns this interferometer without any fine tuning, achieving a performance level of a human expert. 

Title: IONet: Learning to Cure the Curse of Drift in Inertial Odometry
Abstract:  Inertial sensors play a pivotal role in indoor localization, which in turn lays the foundation for pervasive personal applications. However, low-cost inertial sensors, as commonly found in smartphones, are plagued by bias and noise, which leads to unbounded growth in error when accelerations are double integrated to obtain displacement. Small errors in state estimation propagate to make odometry virtually unusable in a matter of seconds. We propose to break the cycle of continuous integration, and instead segment inertial data into independent windows. The challenge becomes estimating the latent states of each window, such as velocity and orientation, as these are not directly observable from sensor data. We demonstrate how to formulate this as an optimization problem, and show how deep recurrent neural networks can yield highly accurate trajectories, outperforming state-of-the-art shallow techniques, on a wide range of tests and attachments. In particular, we demonstrate that IONet can generalize to estimate odometry for non-periodic motion, such as a shopping trolley or baby-stroller, an extremely challenging task for existing techniques. 

Title: Modeling Long-horizon Tasks as Sequential Interaction Landscapes
Abstract:  Complex object manipulation tasks often span over long sequences of operations. Task planning over long-time horizons is a challenging and open problem in robotics, and its complexity grows exponentially with an increasing number of subtasks. In this paper we present a deep learning network that learns dependencies and transitions across subtasks solely from a set of demonstration videos. We represent each subtask as an action symbol (e.g. move cup), and show that these symbols can be learned and predicted directly from image observations. Learning from demonstrations and visual observations are two main pillars of our approach. The former makes the learning tractable as it provides the network with information about the most frequent transitions and relevant dependency between subtasks (instead of exploring all possible combination), while the latter allows the network to continuously monitor the task progress and thus to interactively adapt to changes in the environment. We evaluate our framework on two long horizon tasks: (1) block stacking of puzzle pieces being executed by humans, and (2) a robot manipulation task involving pick and place of objects and sliding a cabinet door on a 7-DoF robot arm. We show that complex plans can be carried out when executing the robotic task and the robot can interactively adapt to changes in the environment and recover from failure cases. 

Title: Lidar-based Object Classification with Explicit Occlusion Modeling
Abstract:  LIDAR is one of the most important sensors for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV). Object detection and classification based on lidar point cloud is a key technology for UGV. In object detection and classification, the mutual occlusion between neighboring objects is an important factor affecting the accuracy. In this paper, we consider occlusion as an intrinsic property of the point cloud data. We propose a novel approach that explicitly model the occlusion. The occlusion property is then taken into account in the subsequent classification step. We perform experiments on the KITTI dataset. Experimental results indicate that by utilizing the occlusion property that we modeled, the classifier obtains much better performance. 

Title: Reducing Drift in Visual Odometry by Inferring Sun Direction Using a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network
Abstract:  We present a method to incorporate global orientation information from the sun into a visual odometry pipeline using only the existing image stream, where the sun is typically not visible. We leverage recent advances in Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks to train and implement a sun detection model that infers a three-dimensional sun direction vector from a single RGB image. Crucially, our method also computes a principled uncertainty associated with each prediction, using a Monte Carlo dropout scheme. We incorporate this uncertainty into a sliding window stereo visual odometry pipeline where accurate uncertainty estimates are critical for optimal data fusion. Our Bayesian sun detection model achieves a median error of approximately 12 degrees on the KITTI odometry benchmark training set, and yields improvements of up to 42% in translational ARMSE and 32% in rotational ARMSE compared to standard VO. An open source implementation of our Bayesian CNN sun estimator (Sun-BCNN) using Caffe is available at https://github. com/utiasSTARS/sun-bcnn-vo 

Title: Regularizing Trajectory Optimization with Denoising Autoencoders
Abstract:  Trajectory optimization using a learned model of the environment is one of the core elements of model-based reinforcement learning. This procedure often suffers from exploiting inaccuracies of the learned model. We propose to regularize trajectory optimization by means of a denoising autoencoder that is trained on the same trajectories as the model of the environment. We show that the proposed regularization leads to improved planning with both gradient-based and gradient-free optimizers. We also demonstrate that using regularized trajectory optimization leads to rapid initial learning in a set of popular motor control tasks, which suggests that the proposed approach can be a useful tool for improving sample efficiency. 

Title: FisheyeDistanceNet: Self-Supervised Scale-Aware Distance Estimation using Monocular Fisheye Camera for Autonomous Driving
Abstract:  Fisheye cameras are commonly used in applications like autonomous driving and surveillance to provide a large field of view ($>180^{\circ}$). However, they come at the cost of strong non-linear distortions which require more complex algorithms. In this paper, we explore Euclidean distance estimation on fisheye cameras for automotive scenes. Obtaining accurate and dense depth supervision is difficult in practice, but self-supervised learning approaches show promising results and could potentially overcome the problem. We present a novel self-supervised scale-aware framework for learning Euclidean distance and ego-motion from raw monocular fisheye videos without applying rectification. While it is possible to perform piece-wise linear approximation of fisheye projection surface and apply standard rectilinear models, it has its own set of issues like re-sampling distortion and discontinuities in transition regions. To encourage further research in this area, we will release our dataset as part of the WoodScape project \cite{yogamani2019woodscape}. We further evaluated the proposed algorithm on the KITTI dataset and obtained state-of-the-art results comparable to other self-supervised monocular methods. Qualitative results on an unseen fisheye video demonstrate impressive performance\footnote{\url{https://youtu.be/Sgq1WzoOmXg}}. 

Title: Curiosity Driven Exploration of Learned Disentangled Goal Spaces
Abstract:  Intrinsically motivated goal exploration processes enable agents to autonomously sample goals to explore efficiently complex environments with high-dimensional continuous actions. They have been applied successfully to real world robots to discover repertoires of policies producing a wide diversity of effects. Often these algorithms relied on engineered goal spaces but it was recently shown that one can use deep representation learning algorithms to learn an adequate goal space in simple environments. However, in the case of more complex environments containing multiple objects or distractors, an efficient exploration requires that the structure of the goal space reflects the one of the environment. In this paper we show that using a disentangled goal space leads to better exploration performances than an entangled goal space. We further show that when the representation is disentangled, one can leverage it by sampling goals that maximize learning progress in a modular manner. Finally, we show that the measure of learning progress, used to drive curiosity-driven exploration, can be used simultaneously to discover abstract independently controllable features of the environment. 

Title: Three-Filters-to-Normal: An Accurate and Ultrafast Surface Normal Estimator
Abstract:  Over the past decade, significant efforts have been made to improve the trade-off between speed and accuracy of surface normal estimators (SNEs). This paper introduces an accurate and ultrafast SNE for structured range data. The proposed approach computes surface normals by simply performing three filtering operations, namely, two image gradient filters (in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively) and a mean/median filter, on an inverse depth image or a disparity image. Despite the simplicity of the method, no similar method already exists in the literature. In our experiments, we created three large-scale synthetic datasets (easy, medium and hard) using 24 3-dimensional (3D) mesh models. Each mesh model is used to generate 1800--2500 pairs of 480x640 pixel depth images and the corresponding surface normal ground truth from different views. The average angular errors with respect to the easy, medium and hard datasets are 1.6 degrees, 5.6 degrees and 15.3 degrees, respectively. Our C++ and CUDA implementations achieve a processing speed of over 260 Hz and 21 kHz, respectively. Our proposed SNE achieves a better overall performance than all other existing computer vision-based SNEs. Our datasets and source code are publicly available at: sites.google.com/view/3f2n. 

Title: LDLS: 3-D Object Segmentation Through Label Diffusion From 2-D Images
Abstract:  Object segmentation in three-dimensional (3-D) point clouds is a critical task for robots capable of 3-D perception. Despite the impressive performance of deep learning-based approaches on object segmentation in 2-D images, deep learning has not been applied nearly as successfully for 3-D point cloud segmentation. Deep networks generally require large amounts of labeled training data, which are readily available for 2-D images but are difficult to produce for 3-D point clouds. In this letter, we present Label Diffusion Lidar Segmentation (LDLS), a novel approach for 3-D point cloud segmentation, which leverages 2-D segmentation of an RGB image from an aligned camera to avoid the need for training on annotated 3-D data. We obtain 2-D segmentation predictions by applying Mask-RCNN to the RGB image, and then link this image to a 3-D lidar point cloud by building a graph of connections among 3-D points and 2-D pixels. This graph then directs a semi-supervised label diffusion process, where the 2-D pixels act as source nodes that diffuse object label information through the 3-D point cloud, resulting in a complete 3-D point cloud segmentation. We conduct empirical studies on the KITTI benchmark dataset and on a mobile robot, demonstrating wide applicability and superior performance of LDLS compared with the previous state of the art in 3-D point cloud segmentation, without any need for either 3-D training data or fine tuning of the 2-D image segmentation model. 

Title: ActiveMoCap: Optimized Viewpoint Selection for Active Human Motion Capture
Abstract:  The accuracy of monocular 3D human pose estimation depends on the viewpoint from which the image is captured. While freely moving cameras, such as on drones, provide control over this viewpoint, automatically positioning them at the location which will yield the highest accuracy remains an open problem. This is the problem that we address in this paper. Specifically, given a short video sequence, we introduce an algorithm that predicts which viewpoints should be chosen to capture future frames so as to maximize 3D human pose estimation accuracy. The key idea underlying our approach is a method to estimate the uncertainty of the 3D body pose estimates. We integrate several sources of uncertainty, originating from deep learning based regressors and temporal smoothness. Our motion planner yields improved 3D body pose estimates and outperforms or matches existing ones that are based on person following and orbiting. 

Title: Semantic3D.net: A new Large-scale Point Cloud Classification Benchmark
Abstract:  This paper presents a new 3D point cloud classification benchmark data set with over four billion manually labelled points, meant as input for data-hungry (deep) learning methods. We also discuss first submissions to the benchmark that use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a work horse, which already show remarkable performance improvements over state-of-the-art. CNNs have become the de-facto standard for many tasks in computer vision and machine learning like semantic segmentation or object detection in images, but have no yet led to a true breakthrough for 3D point cloud labelling tasks due to lack of training data. With the massive data set presented in this paper, we aim at closing this data gap to help unleash the full potential of deep learning methods for 3D labelling tasks. Our semantic3D.net data set consists of dense point clouds acquired with static terrestrial laser scanners. It contains 8 semantic classes and covers a wide range of urban outdoor scenes: churches, streets, railroad tracks, squares, villages, soccer fields and castles. We describe our labelling interface and show that our data set provides more dense and complete point clouds with much higher overall number of labelled points compared to those already available to the research community. We further provide baseline method descriptions and comparison between methods submitted to our online system. We hope semantic3D.net will pave the way for deep learning methods in 3D point cloud labelling to learn richer, more general 3D representations, and first submissions after only a few months indicate that this might indeed be the case. 

Title: An Efficient Sampling-based Method for Online Informative Path Planning in Unknown Environments
Abstract:  The ability to plan informative paths online is essential to robot autonomy. In particular, sampling-based approaches are often used as they are capable of using arbitrary information gain formulations. However, they are prone to local minima, resulting in sub-optimal trajectories, and sometimes do not reach global coverage. In this paper, we present a new RRT*-inspired online informative path planning algorithm. Our method continuously expands a single tree of candidate trajectories and rewires segments to maintain the tree and refine intermediate trajectories. This allows the algorithm to achieve global coverage and maximize the utility of a path in a global context, using a single objective function. We demonstrate the algorithm's capabilities in the applications of autonomous indoor exploration as well as accurate Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF)-based 3D reconstruction on-board a Micro Aerial vehicle (MAV). We study the impact of commonly used information gain and cost formulations in these scenarios and propose a novel TSDF-based 3D reconstruction gain and cost-utility formulation. Detailed evaluation in realistic simulation environments show that our approach outperforms state of the art methods in these tasks. Experiments on a real MAV demonstrate the ability of our method to robustly plan in real-time, exploring an indoor environment solely with on-board sensing and computation. We make our framework available for future research. 

Title: Simultaneous Localization And Mapping with depth Prediction using Capsule Networks for UAVs
Abstract:  In this paper, we propose an novel implementation of a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system based on a monocular camera from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using Depth prediction performed with Capsule Networks (CapsNet), which possess improvements over the drawbacks of the more widely-used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). An Extended Kalman Filter will assist in estimating the position of the UAV so that we are able to update the belief for the environment. Results will be evaluated on a benchmark dataset to portray the accuracy of our intended approach. 

Title: Efficient and accurate object detection with simultaneous classification and tracking
Abstract:  Interacting with the environment, such as object detection and tracking, is a crucial ability of mobile robots. Besides high accuracy, efficiency in terms of processing effort and energy consumption are also desirable. To satisfy both requirements, we propose a detection framework based on simultaneous classification and tracking in the point stream. In this framework, a tracker performs data association in sequences of the point cloud, guiding the detector to avoid redundant processing (i.e. classifying already-known objects). For objects whose classification is not sufficiently certain, a fusion model is designed to fuse selected key observations that provide different perspectives across the tracking span. Therefore, performance (accuracy and efficiency of detection) can be enhanced. This method is particularly suitable for detecting and tracking moving objects, a process that would require expensive computations if solved using conventional procedures. Experiments were conducted on the benchmark dataset, and the results showed that the proposed method outperforms original tracking-by-detection approaches in both efficiency and accuracy. 

Title: Safe Exploration for Interactive Machine Learning
Abstract:  In Interactive Machine Learning (IML), we iteratively make decisions and obtain noisy observations of an unknown function. While IML methods, e.g., Bayesian optimization and active learning, have been successful in applications, on real-world systems they must provably avoid unsafe decisions. To this end, safe IML algorithms must carefully learn about a priori unknown constraints without making unsafe decisions. Existing algorithms for this problem learn about the safety of all decisions to ensure convergence. This is sample-inefficient, as it explores decisions that are not relevant for the original IML objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that renders any existing unsafe IML algorithm safe. Our method works as an add-on that takes suggested decisions as input and exploits regularity assumptions in terms of a Gaussian process prior in order to efficiently learn about their safety. As a result, we only explore the safe set when necessary for the IML problem. We apply our framework to safe Bayesian optimization and to safe exploration in deterministic Markov Decision Processes (MDP), which have been analyzed separately before. Our method outperforms other algorithms empirically. 

Title: Grasping Using Tactile Sensing and Deep Calibration
Abstract:  Tactile perception is an essential ability of intelligent robots in interaction with their surrounding environments. This perception as an intermediate level acts between sensation and action and has to be defined properly to generate suitable action in response to sensed data. In this paper, we propose a feedback approach to address robot grasping task using force-torque tactile sensing. While visual perception is an essential part for gross reaching, constant utilization of this sensing modality can negatively affect the grasping process with overwhelming computation. In such case, human being utilizes tactile sensing to interact with objects. Inspired by, the proposed approach is presented and evaluated on a real robot to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested framework. Moreover, we utilize a deep learning framework called Deep Calibration in order to eliminate the effect of bias in the collected data from the robot sensors. 

Title: Learning Your Way Without Map or Compass: Panoramic Target Driven Visual Navigation
Abstract:  We present a robot navigation system that uses an imitation learning framework to successfully navigate in complex environments. Our framework takes a pre-built 3D scan of a real environment and trains an agent from pre-generated expert trajectories to navigate to any position given a panoramic view of the goal and the current visual input without relying on map, compass, odometry, GPS or relative position of the target at runtime. Our end-to-end trained agent uses RGB and depth (RGBD) information and can handle large environments (up to $1031m^2$) across multiple rooms (up to $40$) and generalizes to unseen targets. We show that when compared to several baselines using deep reinforcement learning and RGBD SLAM, our method (1) requires fewer training examples and less training time, (2) reaches the goal location with higher accuracy, (3) produces better solutions with shorter paths for long-range navigation tasks, and (4) generalizes to unseen environments given an RGBD map of the environment. 

Title: LaserFlow: Efficient and Probabilistic Object Detection and Motion Forecasting
Abstract:  In this work, we present LaserFlow, an efficient method for 3D object detection and motion forecasting from LiDAR. Unlike the previous work, our approach utilizes the native range view representation of the LiDAR, which enables our method to operate at the full range of the sensor in real-time without voxelization or compression of the data. We propose a new multi-sweep fusion architecture, which extracts and merges temporal features directly from the range images. Furthermore, we propose a novel technique for learning a probability distribution over future trajectories inspired by curriculum learning. We evaluate LaserFlow on two autonomous driving datasets and demonstrate competitive results when compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. 

Title: Learning Particle Dynamics for Manipulating Rigid Bodies, Deformable Objects, and Fluids
Abstract:  Real-life control tasks involve matters of various substances---rigid or soft bodies, liquid, gas---each with distinct physical behaviors. This poses challenges to traditional rigid-body physics engines. Particle-based simulators have been developed to model the dynamics of these complex scenes; however, relying on approximation techniques, their simulation often deviates from real-world physics, especially in the long term. In this paper, we propose to learn a particle-based simulator for complex control tasks. Combining learning with particle-based systems brings in two major benefits: first, the learned simulator, just like other particle-based systems, acts widely on objects of different materials; second, the particle-based representation poses strong inductive bias for learning: particles of the same type have the same dynamics within. This enables the model to quickly adapt to new environments of unknown dynamics within a few observations. We demonstrate robots achieving complex manipulation tasks using the learned simulator, such as manipulating fluids and deformable foam, with experiments both in simulation and in the real world. Our study helps lay the foundation for robot learning of dynamic scenes with particle-based representations. 

Title: Synthesis of Shared Control Protocols with Provable Safety and Performance Guarantees
Abstract:  We formalize synthesis of shared control protocols with correctness guarantees for temporal logic specifications. More specifically, we introduce a modeling formalism in which both a human and an autonomy protocol can issue commands to a robot towards performing a certain task. These commands are blended into a joint input to the robot. The autonomy protocol is synthesized using an abstraction of possible human commands accounting for randomness in decisions caused by factors such as fatigue or incomprehensibility of the problem at hand. The synthesis is designed to ensure that the resulting robot behavior satisfies given safety and performance specifications, e.g., in temporal logic. Our solution is based on nonlinear programming and we address the inherent scalability issue by presenting alternative methods. We assess the feasibility and the scalability of the approach by an experimental evaluation. 

Title: Optimal and Learning Control for Autonomous Robots
Abstract:  Optimal and Learning Control for Autonomous Robots has been taught in the Robotics, Systems and Controls Masters at ETH Zurich with the aim to teach optimal control and reinforcement learning for closed loop control problems from a unified point of view. The starting point is the formulation of of an optimal control problem and deriving the different types of solutions and algorithms from there. These lecture notes aim at supporting this unified view with a unified notation wherever possible, and a bit of a translation help to compare the terminology and notation in the different fields. The course assumes basic knowledge of Control Theory, Linear Algebra and Stochastic Calculus. 

Title: What can I do here? Leveraging Deep 3D saliency and geometry for fast and scalable multiple affordance detection
Abstract:  This paper develops and evaluates a novel method that allows for the detection of affordances in a scalable and multiple-instance manner on visually recovered pointclouds. Our approach has many advantages over alternative methods, as it is based on highly parallelizable, one-shot learning that is fast in commodity hardware. The approach is hybrid in that it uses a geometric representation together with a state-of-the-art deep learning method capable of identifying 3D scene saliency. The geometric component allows for a compact and efficient representation, boosting the performance of the deep network architecture which proved insufficient on its own. Moreover, our approach allows not only to predict whether an input scene affords or not the interactions, but also the pose of the objects that allow these interactions to take place. Our predictions align well with crowd-sourced human judgment as they are preferred with 87% probability, show high rates of improvement with almost four times (4x) better performance over a deep learning-only baseline and are seven times (7x) faster than previous art. 

Title: Visibility Guided NMS: Efficient Boosting of Amodal Object Detection in Crowded Traffic Scenes
Abstract:  Object detection is an important task in environment perception for autonomous driving. Modern 2D object detection frameworks such as Yolo, SSD or Faster R-CNN predict multiple bounding boxes per object that are refined using Non-Maximum-Suppression (NMS) to suppress all but one bounding box. While object detection itself is fully end-to-end learnable and does not require any manual parameter selection, standard NMS is parametrized by an overlap threshold that has to be chosen by hand. In practice, this often leads to an inability of standard NMS strategies to distinguish different objects in crowded scenes in the presence of high mutual occlusion, e.g. for parked cars or crowds of pedestrians. Our novel Visibility Guided NMS (vg-NMS) leverages both pixel-based as well as amodal object detection paradigms and improves the detection performance especially for highly occluded objects with little computational overhead. We evaluate vg-NMS using KITTI, VIPER as well as the Synscapes dataset and show that it outperforms current state-of-the-art NMS. 

Title: Physics-Based Dexterous Manipulations with Estimated Hand Poses and Residual Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Dexterous manipulation of objects in virtual environments with our bare hands, by using only a depth sensor and a state-of-the-art 3D hand pose estimator (HPE), is challenging. While virtual environments are ruled by physics, e.g. object weights and surface frictions, the absence of force feedback makes the task challenging, as even slight inaccuracies on finger tips or contact points from HPE may make the interactions fail. Prior arts simply generate contact forces in the direction of the fingers' closures, when finger joints penetrate virtual objects. Although useful for simple grasping scenarios, they cannot be applied to dexterous manipulations such as in-hand manipulation. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) approaches train agents that learn skills by using task-specific rewards, without considering any online user input. In this work, we propose to learn a model that maps noisy input hand poses to target virtual poses, which introduces the needed contacts to accomplish the tasks on a physics simulator. The agent is trained in a residual setting by using a model-free hybrid RL+IL approach. A 3D hand pose estimation reward is introduced leading to an improvement on HPE accuracy when the physics-guided corrected target poses are remapped to the input space. As the model corrects HPE errors by applying minor but crucial joint displacements for contacts, this helps to keep the generated motion visually close to the user input. Since HPE sequences performing successful virtual interactions do not exist, a data generation scheme to train and evaluate the system is proposed. We test our framework in two applications that use hand pose estimates for dexterous manipulations: hand-object interactions in VR and hand-object motion reconstruction in-the-wild. 

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Assisted Vehicular Networks
Abstract:  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to complement the 5G communication infrastructure in future smart cities. Hot spots easily appear in road intersections, where effective communication among vehicles is challenging. UAVs may serve as relays with the advantages of low price, easy deployment, line-of-sight links, and flexible mobility. In this paper, we study a UAV-assisted vehicular network where the UAV jointly adjusts its transmission control (power and channel) and 3D flight to maximize the total throughput. First, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) problem by modeling the mobility of the UAV/vehicles and the state transitions. Secondly, we solve the target problem using a deep reinforcement learning method under unknown or unmeasurable environment variables especially in 5G, namely, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and propose three solutions with different control objectives. Environment variables are unknown and unmeasurable, therefore, we use a deep reinforcement learning method. Moreover, considering the energy consumption of 3D flight, we extend the proposed solutions to maximize the total throughput per energy unit by encouraging or discouraging the UAV's mobility. To achieve this goal, the DDPG framework is modified. Thirdly, in a simplified model with small state space and action space, we verify the optimality of proposed algorithms. Comparing with two baseline schemes, we demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms in a realistic model. 

Title: ReLMoGen: Leveraging Motion Generation in Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Manipulation
Abstract:  Many Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches use joint control signals (positions, velocities, torques) as action space for continuous control tasks. We propose to lift the action space to a higher level in the form of subgoals for a motion generator (a combination of motion planner and trajectory executor). We argue that, by lifting the action space and by leveraging sampling-based motion planners, we can efficiently use RL to solve complex, long-horizon tasks that could not be solved with existing RL methods in the original action space. We propose ReLMoGen -- a framework that combines a learned policy to predict subgoals and a motion generator to plan and execute the motion needed to reach these subgoals. To validate our method, we apply ReLMoGen to two types of tasks: 1) Interactive Navigation tasks, navigation problems where interactions with the environment are required to reach the destination, and 2) Mobile Manipulation tasks, manipulation tasks that require moving the robot base. These problems are challenging because they are usually long-horizon, hard to explore during training, and comprise alternating phases of navigation and interaction. Our method is benchmarked on a diverse set of seven robotics tasks in photo-realistic simulation environments. In all settings, ReLMoGen outperforms state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning baselines. ReLMoGen also shows outstanding transferability between different motion generators at test time, indicating a great potential to transfer to real robots. 

Title: PAC-Bayes Control: Learning Policies that Provably Generalize to Novel Environments
Abstract:  Our goal is to learn control policies for robots that provably generalize well to novel environments given a dataset of example environments. The key technical idea behind our approach is to leverage tools from generalization theory in machine learning by exploiting a precise analogy (which we present in the form of a reduction) between generalization of control policies to novel environments and generalization of hypotheses in the supervised learning setting. In particular, we utilize the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes framework, which allows us to obtain upper bounds that hold with high probability on the expected cost of (stochastic) control policies across novel environments. We propose policy learning algorithms that explicitly seek to minimize this upper bound. The corresponding optimization problem can be solved using convex optimization (Relative Entropy Programming in particular) in the setting where we are optimizing over a finite policy space. In the more general setting of continuously parameterized policies (e.g., neural network policies), we minimize this upper bound using stochastic gradient descent. We present simulated results of our approach applied to learning (1) reactive obstacle avoidance policies and (2) neural network-based grasping policies. We also present hardware results for the Parrot Swing drone navigating through different obstacle environments. Our examples demonstrate the potential of our approach to provide strong generalization guarantees for robotic systems with continuous state and action spaces, complicated (e.g., nonlinear) dynamics, rich sensory inputs (e.g., depth images), and neural network-based policies. 

Title: Training Adversarial Agents to Exploit Weaknesses in Deep Control Policies
Abstract:  Deep learning has become an increasingly common technique for various control problems, such as robotic arm manipulation, robot navigation, and autonomous vehicles. However, the downside of using deep neural networks to learn control policies is their opaque nature and the difficulties of validating their safety. As the networks used to obtain state-of-the-art results become increasingly deep and complex, the rules they have learned and how they operate become more challenging to understand. This presents an issue, since in safety-critical applications the safety of the control policy must be ensured to a high confidence level. In this paper, we propose an automated black box testing framework based on adversarial reinforcement learning. The technique uses an adversarial agent, whose goal is to degrade the performance of the target model under test. We test the approach on an autonomous vehicle problem, by training an adversarial reinforcement learning agent, which aims to cause a deep neural network-driven autonomous vehicle to collide. Two neural networks trained for autonomous driving are compared, and the results from the testing are used to compare the robustness of their learned control policies. We show that the proposed framework is able to find weaknesses in both control policies that were not evident during online testing and therefore, demonstrate a significant benefit over manual testing methods. 

Title: Urban Driving with Conditional Imitation Learning
Abstract:  Hand-crafting generalised decision-making rules for real-world urban autonomous driving is hard. Alternatively, learning behaviour from easy-to-collect human driving demonstrations is appealing. Prior work has studied imitation learning (IL) for autonomous driving with a number of limitations. Examples include only performing lane-following rather than following a user-defined route, only using a single camera view or heavily cropped frames lacking state observability, only lateral (steering) control, but not longitudinal (speed) control and a lack of interaction with traffic. Importantly, the majority of such systems have been primarily evaluated in simulation - a simple domain, which lacks real-world complexities. Motivated by these challenges, we focus on learning representations of semantics, geometry and motion with computer vision for IL from human driving demonstrations. As our main contribution, we present an end-to-end conditional imitation learning approach, combining both lateral and longitudinal control on a real vehicle for following urban routes with simple traffic. We address inherent dataset bias by data balancing, training our final policy on approximately 30 hours of demonstrations gathered over six months. We evaluate our method on an autonomous vehicle by driving 35km of novel routes in European urban streets. 

Title: Online Inference and Detection of Curbs in Partially Occluded Scenes with Sparse LIDAR
Abstract:  Road boundaries, or curbs, provide autonomous vehicles with essential information when interpreting road scenes and generating behaviour plans. Although curbs convey important information, they are difficult to detect in complex urban environments (in particular in comparison to other elements of the road such as traffic signs and road markings). These difficulties arise from occlusions by other traffic participants as well as changing lighting and/or weather conditions. Moreover, road boundaries have various shapes, colours and structures while motion planning algorithms require accurate and precise metric information in real-time to generate their plans. In this paper, we present a real-time LIDAR-based approach for accurate curb detection around the vehicle (360 degree). Our approach deals with both occlusions from traffic and changing environmental conditions. To this end, we project 3D LIDAR pointcloud data into 2D bird's-eye view images (akin to Inverse Perspective Mapping). These images are then processed by trained deep networks to infer both visible and occluded road boundaries. Finally, a post-processing step filters detected curb segments and tracks them over time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on real-world driving data. Hence, we believe that our LIDAR-based approach provides an efficient and effective way to detect visible and occluded curbs around the vehicles in challenging driving scenarios. 

Title: GASP : Geometric Association with Surface Patches
Abstract:  A fundamental challenge to sensory processing tasks in perception and robotics is the problem of obtaining data associations across views. We present a robust solution for ascertaining potentially dense surface patch (superpixel) associations, requiring just range information. Our approach involves decomposition of a view into regularized surface patches. We represent them as sequences expressing geometry invariantly over their superpixel neighborhoods, as uniquely consistent partial orderings. We match these representations through an optimal sequence comparison metric based on the Damerau-Levenshtein distance - enabling robust association with quadratic complexity (in contrast to hitherto employed joint matching formulations which are NP-complete). The approach is able to perform under wide baselines, heavy rotations, partial overlaps, significant occlusions and sensor noise. The technique does not require any priors -- motion or otherwise, and does not make restrictive assumptions on scene structure and sensor movement. It does not require appearance -- is hence more widely applicable than appearance reliant methods, and invulnerable to related ambiguities such as textureless or aliased content. We present promising qualitative and quantitative results under diverse settings, along with comparatives with popular approaches based on range as well as RGB-D data. 

Title: Learning of Coordination Policies for Robotic Swarms
Abstract:  Inspired by biological swarms, robotic swarms are envisioned to solve real-world problems that are difficult for individual agents. Biological swarms can achieve collective intelligence based on local interactions and simple rules; however, designing effective distributed policies for large-scale robotic swarms to achieve a global objective can be challenging. Although it is often possible to design an optimal centralized strategy for smaller numbers of agents, those methods can fail as the number of agents increases. Motivated by the growing success of machine learning, we develop a deep learning approach that learns distributed coordination policies from centralized policies. In contrast to traditional distributed control approaches, which are usually based on human-designed policies for relatively simple tasks, this learning-based approach can be adapted to more difficult tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach on two different tasks, the well-known rendezvous problem and a more difficult particle assignment problem. For the latter, no known distributed policy exists. From extensive simulations, it is shown that the performance of the learned coordination policies is comparable to the centralized policies, surpassing state-of-the-art distributed policies. Thereby, our proposed approach provides a promising alternative for real-world coordination problems that would be otherwise computationally expensive to solve or intangible to explore. 

Title: Dream to Control: Learning Behaviors by Latent Imagination
Abstract:  Learned world models summarize an agent's experience to facilitate learning complex behaviors. While learning world models from high-dimensional sensory inputs is becoming feasible through deep learning, there are many potential ways for deriving behaviors from them. We present Dreamer, a reinforcement learning agent that solves long-horizon tasks from images purely by latent imagination. We efficiently learn behaviors by propagating analytic gradients of learned state values back through trajectories imagined in the compact state space of a learned world model. On 20 challenging visual control tasks, Dreamer exceeds existing approaches in data-efficiency, computation time, and final performance. 

Title: MultiNet: Multi-Modal Multi-Task Learning for Autonomous Driving
Abstract:  Autonomous driving requires operation in different behavioral modes ranging from lane following and intersection crossing to turning and stopping. However, most existing deep learning approaches to autonomous driving do not consider the behavioral mode in the training strategy. This paper describes a technique for learning multiple distinct behavioral modes in a single deep neural network through the use of multi-modal multi-task learning. We study the effectiveness of this approach, denoted MultiNet, using self-driving model cars for driving in unstructured environments such as sidewalks and unpaved roads. Using labeled data from over one hundred hours of driving our fleet of 1/10th scale model cars, we trained different neural networks to predict the steering angle and driving speed of the vehicle in different behavioral modes. We show that in each case, MultiNet networks outperform networks trained on individual modes while using a fraction of the total number of parameters. 

Title: Evaluating task-agnostic exploration for fixed-batch learning of arbitrary future tasks
Abstract:  Deep reinforcement learning has been shown to solve challenging tasks where large amounts of training experience is available, usually obtained online while learning the task. Robotics is a significant potential application domain for many of these algorithms, but generating robot experience in the real world is expensive, especially when each task requires a lengthy online training procedure. Off-policy algorithms can in principle learn arbitrary tasks from a diverse enough fixed dataset. In this work, we evaluate popular exploration methods by generating robotics datasets for the purpose of learning to solve tasks completely offline without any further interaction in the real world. We present results on three popular continuous control tasks in simulation, as well as continuous control of a high-dimensional real robot arm. Code documenting all algorithms, experiments, and hyper-parameters is available at https://github.com/qutrobotlearning/batchlearning. 

Title: Dynamics Learning with Cascaded Variational Inference for Multi-Step Manipulation
Abstract:  The fundamental challenge of planning for multi-step manipulation is to find effective and plausible action sequences that lead to the task goal. We present Cascaded Variational Inference (CAVIN) Planner, a model-based method that hierarchically generates plans by sampling from latent spaces. To facilitate planning over long time horizons, our method learns latent representations that decouple the prediction of high-level effects from the generation of low-level motions through cascaded variational inference. This enables us to model dynamics at two different levels of temporal resolutions for hierarchical planning. We evaluate our approach in three multi-step robotic manipulation tasks in cluttered tabletop environments given high-dimensional observations. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art model-based methods by strategically interacting with multiple objects. 

Title: SceneEDNet: A Deep Learning Approach for Scene Flow Estimation
Abstract:  Estimating scene flow in RGB-D videos is attracting much interest of the computer vision researchers, due to its potential applications in robotics. The state-of-the-art techniques for scene flow estimation, typically rely on the knowledge of scene structure of the frame and the correspondence between frames. However, with the increasing amount of RGB-D data captured from sophisticated sensors like Microsoft Kinect, and the recent advances in the area of sophisticated deep learning techniques, introduction of an efficient deep learning technique for scene flow estimation, is becoming important. This paper introduces a first effort to apply a deep learning method for direct estimation of scene flow by presenting a fully convolutional neural network with an encoder-decoder (ED) architecture. The proposed network SceneEDNet involves estimation of three dimensional motion vectors of all the scene points from sequence of stereo images. The training for direct estimation of scene flow is done using consecutive pairs of stereo images and corresponding scene flow ground truth. The proposed architecture is applied on a huge dataset and provides meaningful results. 

Title: Knowledge is Never Enough: Towards Web Aided Deep Open World Recognition
Abstract:  While today's robots are able to perform sophisticated tasks, they can only act on objects they have been trained to recognize. This is a severe limitation: any robot will inevitably see new objects in unconstrained settings, and thus will always have visual knowledge gaps. However, standard visual modules are usually built on a limited set of classes and are based on the strong prior that an object must belong to one of those classes. Identifying whether an instance does not belong to the set of known categories (i.e. open set recognition), only partially tackles this problem, as a truly autonomous agent should be able not only to detect what it does not know, but also to extend dynamically its knowledge about the world. We contribute to this challenge with a deep learning architecture that can dynamically update its known classes in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed deep network, based on a deep extension of a non-parametric model, detects whether a perceived object belongs to the set of categories known by the system and learns it without the need to retrain the whole system from scratch. Annotated images about the new category can be provided by an 'oracle' (i.e. human supervision), or by autonomous mining of the Web. Experiments on two different databases and on a robot platform demonstrate the promise of our approach. 

Title: Crossing The Gap: A Deep Dive into Zero-Shot Sim-to-Real Transfer for Dynamics
Abstract:  Zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of tasks with complex dynamics is a highly challenging and unsolved problem. A number of solutions have been proposed in recent years, but we have found that many works do not present a thorough evaluation in the real world, or underplay the significant engineering effort and task-specific fine tuning that is required to achieve the published results. In this paper, we dive deeper into the sim-to-real transfer challenge, investigate why this is such a difficult problem, and present objective evaluations of a number of transfer methods across a range of real-world tasks. Surprisingly, we found that a method which simply injects random forces into the simulation performs just as well as more complex methods, such as those which randomise the simulator's dynamics parameters, or adapt a policy online using recurrent network architectures. 

Title: Single-View and Multi-View Depth Fusion
Abstract:  Dense and accurate 3D mapping from a monocular sequence is a key technology for several applications and still an open research area. This paper leverages recent results on single-view CNN-based depth estimation and fuses them with multi-view depth estimation. Both approaches present complementary strengths. Multi-view depth is highly accurate but only in high-texture areas and high-parallax cases. Single-view depth captures the local structure of mid-level regions, including texture-less areas, but the estimated depth lacks global coherence. The single and multi-view fusion we propose is challenging in several aspects. First, both depths are related by a deformation that depends on the image content. Second, the selection of multi-view points of high accuracy might be difficult for low-parallax configurations. We present contributions for both problems. Our results in the public datasets of NYUv2 and TUM shows that our algorithm outperforms the individual single and multi-view approaches. A video showing the key aspects of mapping in our Single and Multi-view depth proposal is available at https://youtu.be/ipc5HukTb4k 

Title: FollowNet: Robot Navigation by Following Natural Language Directions with Deep Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Understanding and following directions provided by humans can enable robots to navigate effectively in unknown situations. We present FollowNet, an end-to-end differentiable neural architecture for learning multi-modal navigation policies. FollowNet maps natural language instructions as well as visual and depth inputs to locomotion primitives. FollowNet processes instructions using an attention mechanism conditioned on its visual and depth input to focus on the relevant parts of the command while performing the navigation task. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) a sparse reward learns simultaneously the state representation, the attention function, and control policies. We evaluate our agent on a dataset of complex natural language directions that guide the agent through a rich and realistic dataset of simulated homes. We show that the FollowNet agent learns to execute previously unseen instructions described with a similar vocabulary, and successfully navigates along paths not encountered during training. The agent shows 30% improvement over a baseline model without the attention mechanism, with 52% success rate at novel instructions. 

Title: DIViS: Domain Invariant Visual Servoing for Collision-Free Goal Reaching
Abstract:  Robots should understand both semantics and physics to be functional in the real world. While robot platforms provide means for interacting with the physical world they cannot autonomously acquire object-level semantics without needing human. In this paper, we investigate how to minimize human effort and intervention to teach robots perform real world tasks that incorporate semantics. We study this question in the context of visual servoing of mobile robots and propose DIViS, a Domain Invariant policy learning approach for collision free Visual Servoing. DIViS incorporates high level semantics from previously collected static human-labeled datasets and learns collision free servoing entirely in simulation and without any real robot data. However, DIViS can directly be deployed on a real robot and is capable of servoing to the user-specified object categories while avoiding collisions in the real world. DIViS is not constrained to be queried by the final view of goal but rather is robust to servo to image goals taken from initial robot view with high occlusions without this impairing its ability to maintain a collision free path. We show the generalization capability of DIViS on real mobile robots in more than 90 real world test scenarios with various unseen object goals in unstructured environments. DIViS is compared to prior approaches via real world experiments and rigorous tests in simulation.

Title: Risk-Averse MPC via Visual-Inertial Input and Recurrent Networks for Online Collision Avoidance
Abstract:  In this paper, we propose an online path planning architecture that extends the model predictive control (MPC) formulation to consider future location uncertainties for safer navigation through cluttered environments. Our algorithm combines an object detection pipeline with a recurrent neural network (RNN) which infers the covariance of state estimates through each step of our MPC's finite time horizon. The RNN model is trained on a dataset that comprises of robot and landmark poses generated from camera images and inertial measurement unit (IMU) readings via a state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry framework. To detect and extract object locations for avoidance, we use a custom-trained convolutional neural network model in conjunction with a feature extractor to retrieve 3D centroid and radii boundaries of nearby obstacles. The robustness of our methods is validated on complex quadruped robot dynamics and can be generally applied to most robotic platforms, demonstrating autonomous behaviors that can plan fast and collision-free paths towards a goal point. 

Title: Deep Workpiece Region Segmentation for Bin Picking
Abstract:  For most industrial bin picking solutions, the pose of a workpiece is localized by matching a CAD model to point cloud obtained from 3D sensor. Distinguishing flat workpieces from bottom of the bin in point cloud imposes challenges in the localization of workpieces that lead to wrong or phantom detections. In this paper, we propose a framework that solves this problem by automatically segmenting workpiece regions from non-workpiece regions in a point cloud data. It is done in real time by applying a fully convolutional neural network trained on both simulated and real data. The real data has been labelled by our novel technique which automatically generates ground truth labels for real point clouds. Along with real time workpiece segmentation, our framework also helps in improving the number of detected workpieces and estimating the correct object poses. Moreover, it decreases the computation time by approximately 1s due to a reduction of the search space for the object pose estimation. 

Title: Towards an Embodied Semantic Fovea: Semantic 3D scene reconstruction from ego-centric eye-tracker videos
Abstract:  Incorporating the physical environment is essential for a complete understanding of human behavior in unconstrained every-day tasks. This is especially important in ego-centric tasks where obtaining 3 dimensional information is both limiting and challenging with the current 2D video analysis methods proving insufficient. Here we demonstrate a proof-of-concept system which provides real-time 3D mapping and semantic labeling of the local environment from an ego-centric RGB-D video-stream with 3D gaze point estimation from head mounted eye tracking glasses. We augment existing work in Semantic Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (Semantic SLAM) with collected gaze vectors. Our system can then find and track objects both inside and outside the user field-of-view in 3D from multiple perspectives with reasonable accuracy. We validate our concept by producing a semantic map from images of the NYUv2 dataset while simultaneously estimating gaze position and gaze classes from recorded gaze data of the dataset images. 

Title: Object segmentation in depth maps with one user click and a synthetically trained fully convolutional network
Abstract:  With more and more household objects built on planned obsolescence and consumed by a fast-growing population, hazardous waste recycling has become a critical challenge. Given the large variability of household waste, current recycling platforms mostly rely on human operators to analyze the scene, typically composed of many object instances piled up in bulk. Helping them by robotizing the unitary extraction is a key challenge to speed up this tedious process. Whereas supervised deep learning has proven very efficient for such object-level scene understanding, e.g., generic object detection and segmentation in everyday scenes, it however requires large sets of per-pixel labeled images, that are hardly available for numerous application contexts, including industrial robotics. We thus propose a step towards a practical interactive application for generating an object-oriented robotic grasp, requiring as inputs only one depth map of the scene and one user click on the next object to extract. More precisely, we address in this paper the middle issue of object seg-mentation in top views of piles of bulk objects given a pixel location, namely seed, provided interactively by a human operator. We propose a twofold framework for generating edge-driven instance segments. First, we repurpose a state-of-the-art fully convolutional object contour detector for seed-based instance segmentation by introducing the notion of edge-mask duality with a novel patch-free and contour-oriented loss function. Second, we train one model using only synthetic scenes, instead of manually labeled training data. Our experimental results show that considering edge-mask duality for training an encoder-decoder network, as we suggest, outperforms a state-of-the-art patch-based network in the present application context. 

Title: Physics-based Simulation of Continuous-Wave LIDAR for Localization, Calibration and Tracking
Abstract:  Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors play an important role in the perception stack of autonomous robots, supplying mapping and localization pipelines with depth measurements of the environment. While their accuracy outperforms other types of depth sensors, such as stereo or time-of-flight cameras, the accurate modeling of LIDAR sensors requires laborious manual calibration that typically does not take into account the interaction of laser light with different surface types, incidence angles and other phenomena that significantly influence measurements. In this work, we introduce a physically plausible model of a 2D continuous-wave LIDAR that accounts for the surface-light interactions and simulates the measurement process in the Hokuyo URG-04LX LIDAR. Through automatic differentiation, we employ gradient-based optimization to estimate model parameters from real sensor measurements. 

Title: Extrinsic Calibration of 3D Range Finder and Camera without Auxiliary Object or Human Intervention
Abstract:  Fusion of heterogeneous extroceptive sensors is the most effient and effective way to representing the environment precisely, as it overcomes various defects of each homogeneous sensor. The rigid transformation (aka. extrinsic parameters) of heterogeneous sensory systems should be available before precisely fusing the multisensor information. Researchers have proposed several approaches to estimating the extrinsic parameters. These approaches require either auxiliary objects, like chessboards, or extra help from human to select correspondences. In this paper, we proposed a novel extrinsic calibration approach for the extrinsic calibration of range and image sensors. As far as we know, it is the first automatic approach with no requirement of auxiliary objects or any human interventions. First, we estimate the initial extrinsic parameters from the individual motion of the range finder and the camera. Then we extract lines in the image and point-cloud pairs, to refine the line feature associations by the initial extrinsic parameters. At the end, we discussed the degenerate case which may lead to the algorithm failure and validate our approach by simulation. The results indicate high-precision extrinsic calibration results against the ground-truth. 

Title: Maximum Causal Entropy Specification Inference from Demonstrations
Abstract:  In many settings (e.g., robotics) demonstrations provide a natural way to specify tasks; however, most methods for learning from demonstrations either do not provide guarantees that the artifacts learned for the tasks, such as rewards or policies, can be safely composed and/or do not explicitly capture history dependencies. Motivated by this deficit, recent works have proposed learning Boolean task specifications, a class of Boolean non-Markovian rewards which admit well-defined composition and explicitly handle historical dependencies. This work continues this line of research by adapting maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning to estimate the posteriori probability of a specification given a multi-set of demonstrations. The key algorithmic insight is to leverage the extensive literature and tooling on reduced ordered binary decision diagrams to efficiently encode a time unrolled Markov Decision Process. This enables transforming a naive exponential time algorithm into a polynomial time algorithm. 

Title: Learning Navigation Costs from Demonstration in Partially Observable Environments
Abstract:  This paper focuses on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to enable safe and efficient autonomous navigation in unknown partially observable environments. The objective is to infer a cost function that explains expert-demonstrated navigation behavior while relying only on the observations and state-control trajectory used by the expert. We develop a cost function representation composed of two parts: a probabilistic occupancy encoder, with recurrent dependence on the observation sequence, and a cost encoder, defined over the occupancy features. The representation parameters are optimized by differentiating the error between demonstrated controls and a control policy computed from the cost encoder. Such differentiation is typically computed by dynamic programming through the value function over the whole state space. We observe that this is inefficient in large partially observable environments because most states are unexplored. Instead, we rely on a closed-form subgradient of the cost-to-go obtained only over a subset of promising states via an efficient motion-planning algorithm such as A* or RRT. Our experiments show that our model exceeds the accuracy of baseline IRL algorithms in robot navigation tasks, while substantially improving the efficiency of training and test-time inference. 

Title: From Pixels to Torques: Policy Learning with Deep Dynamical Models
Abstract:  Data-efficient learning in continuous state-action spaces using very high-dimensional observations remains a key challenge in developing fully autonomous systems. In this paper, we consider one instance of this challenge, the pixels to torques problem, where an agent must learn a closed-loop control policy from pixel information only. We introduce a data-efficient, model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that learns such a closed-loop policy directly from pixel information. The key ingredient is a deep dynamical model that uses deep auto-encoders to learn a low-dimensional embedding of images jointly with a predictive model in this low-dimensional feature space. Joint learning ensures that not only static but also dynamic properties of the data are accounted for. This is crucial for long-term predictions, which lie at the core of the adaptive model predictive control strategy that we use for closed-loop control. Compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods for continuous states and actions, our approach learns quickly, scales to high-dimensional state spaces and is an important step toward fully autonomous learning from pixels to torques. 

Title: Safe Reinforcement Learning with Model Uncertainty Estimates
Abstract:  Many current autonomous systems are being designed with a strong reliance on black box predictions from deep neural networks (DNNs). However, DNNs tend to be overconfident in predictions on unseen data and can give unpredictable results for far-from-distribution test data. The importance of predictions that are robust to this distributional shift is evident for safety-critical applications, such as collision avoidance around pedestrians. Measures of model uncertainty can be used to identify unseen data, but the state-of-the-art extraction methods such as Bayesian neural networks are mostly intractable to compute. This paper uses MC-Dropout and Bootstrapping to give computationally tractable and parallelizable uncertainty estimates. The methods are embedded in a Safe Reinforcement Learning framework to form uncertainty-aware navigation around pedestrians. The result is a collision avoidance policy that knows what it does not know and cautiously avoids pedestrians that exhibit unseen behavior. The policy is demonstrated in simulation to be more robust to novel observations and take safer actions than an uncertainty-unaware baseline. 

Title: Video Motion Capture from the Part Confidence Maps of Multi-Camera Images by Spatiotemporal Filtering Using the Human Skeletal Model
Abstract:  This paper discusses video motion capture, namely, 3D reconstruction of human motion from multi-camera images. After the Part Confidence Maps are computed from each camera image, the proposed spatiotemporal filter is applied to deliver the human motion data with accuracy and smoothness for human motion analysis. The spatiotemporal filter uses the human skeleton and mixes temporal smoothing in two-time inverse kinematics computations. The experimental results show that the mean per joint position error was 26.1mm for regular motions and 38.8mm for inverted motions. 

Title: Minimalist Regression Network with Reinforced Gradients and Weighted Estimates: a Case Study on Parameters Estimation in Automated Welding
Abstract:  This paper presents a minimalist neural regression network as an aggregate of independent identical regression blocks that are trained simultaneously. Moreover, it introduces a new multiplicative parameter, shared by all the neural units of a given layer, to maintain the quality of its gradients. Furthermore, it increases its estimation accuracy via learning a weight factor whose quantity captures the redundancy between the estimated and actual values at each training iteration. We choose the estimation of the direct weld parameters of different welding techniques to show a significant improvement in calculation of these parameters by our model in contrast to state-of-the-arts techniques in the literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our model to retain its performance when presented with combined data of different welding techniques. This is a nontrivial result in attaining an scalable model whose quality of estimation is independent of adopted welding techniques. 

Title: Learning sparse representations in reinforcement learning
Abstract:  Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms allow artificial agents to improve their selection of actions to increase rewarding experiences in their environments. Temporal Difference (TD) Learning -- a model-free RL method -- is a leading account of the midbrain dopamine system and the basal ganglia in reinforcement learning. These algorithms typically learn a mapping from the agent's current sensed state to a selected action (known as a policy function) via learning a value function (expected future rewards). TD Learning methods have been very successful on a broad range of control tasks, but learning can become intractably slow as the state space of the environment grows. This has motivated methods that learn internal representations of the agent's state, effectively reducing the size of the state space and restructuring state representations in order to support generalization. However, TD Learning coupled with an artificial neural network, as a function approximator, has been shown to fail to learn some fairly simple control tasks, challenging this explanation of reward-based learning. We hypothesize that such failures do not arise in the brain because of the ubiquitous presence of lateral inhibition in the cortex, producing sparse distributed internal representations that support the learning of expected future reward. The sparse conjunctive representations can avoid catastrophic interference while still supporting generalization. We provide support for this conjecture through computational simulations, demonstrating the benefits of learned sparse representations for three problematic classic control tasks: Puddle-world, Mountain-car, and Acrobot. 

Title: Line-based Camera Pose Estimation in Point Cloud of Structured Environments
Abstract:  Accurate registration of 2D imagery with point clouds is a key technology for image-LiDAR point cloud fusion, camera to laser scanner calibration and camera localization. Despite continuous improvements, automatic registration of 2D and 3D data without using additional textured information still faces great challenges. In this paper, we propose a new 2D-3D registration method to estimate 2D-3D line feature correspondences and the camera pose in untextured point clouds of structured environments. Specifically, we first use geometric constraints between vanishing points and 3D parallel lines to compute all feasible camera rotations. Then, we utilize a hypothesis testing strategy to estimate the 2D-3D line correspondences and the translation vector. By checking the consistency with computed correspondences, the best rotation matrix can be found. Finally, the camera pose is further refined using non-linear optimization with all the 2D-3D line correspondences. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the synthetic and real dataset (outdoors and indoors) with repeated structures and rapid depth changes. 

Title: Anticipating many futures: Online human motion prediction and synthesis for human-robot collaboration
Abstract:  Fluent and safe interactions of humans and robots require both partners to anticipate the others' actions. A common approach to human intention inference is to model specific trajectories towards known goals with supervised classifiers. However, these approaches do not take possible future movements into account nor do they make use of kinematic cues, such as legible and predictable motion. The bottleneck of these methods is the lack of an accurate model of general human motion. In this work, we present a conditional variational autoencoder that is trained to predict a window of future human motion given a window of past frames. Using skeletal data obtained from RGB depth images, we show how this unsupervised approach can be used for online motion prediction for up to 1660 ms. Additionally, we demonstrate online target prediction within the first 300-500 ms after motion onset without the use of target specific training data. The advantage of our probabilistic approach is the possibility to draw samples of possible future motions. Finally, we investigate how movements and kinematic cues are represented on the learned low dimensional manifold. 

Title: DR-SPAAM: A Spatial-Attention and Auto-regressive Model for Person Detection in 2D Range Data
Abstract:  Detecting persons using a 2D LiDAR is a challenging task due to the low information content of 2D range data. To alleviate the problem caused by the sparsity of the LiDAR points, current state-of-the-art methods fuse multiple previous scans and perform detection using the combined scans. The downside of such a backward looking fusion is that all the scans need to be aligned explicitly, and the necessary alignment operation makes the whole pipeline more expensive -- often too expensive for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a person detection network which uses an alternative strategy to combine scans obtained at different times. Our method, Distance Robust SPatial Attention and Auto-regressive Model (DR-SPAAM), follows a forward looking paradigm. It keeps the intermediate features from the backbone network as a template and recurrently updates the template when a new scan becomes available. The updated feature template is in turn used for detecting persons currently in the scene. On the DROW dataset, our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art, while being approximately four times faster, running at 87.2 FPS on a laptop with a dedicated GPU and at 22.6 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX embedded GPU. We release our code in PyTorch and a ROS node including pre-trained models. 

Title: Multi-agent Interactive Prediction under Challenging Driving Scenarios
Abstract:  In order to drive safely on the road, autonomous vehicle is expected to predict future outcomes of its surrounding environment and react properly. In fact, many researchers have been focused on solving behavioral prediction problems for autonomous vehicles. However, very few of them consider multi-agent prediction under challenging driving scenarios such as urban environment. In this paper, we proposed a prediction method that is able to predict various complicated driving scenarios where heterogeneous road entities, signal lights, and static map information are taken into account. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent interactive prediction (MAIP) system is capable of simultaneously predicting any number of road entities while considering their mutual interactions. A case study of a simulated challenging urban intersection scenario is provided to demonstrate the performance and capability of the proposed prediction system. 

Title: Radar-based Road User Classification and Novelty Detection with Recurrent Neural Network Ensembles
Abstract:  Radar-based road user classification is an important yet still challenging task towards autonomous driving applications. The resolution of conventional automotive radar sensors results in a sparse data representation which is tough to recover by subsequent signal processing. In this article, classifier ensembles originating from a one-vs-one binarization paradigm are enriched by one-vs-all correction classifiers. They are utilized to efficiently classify individual traffic participants and also identify hidden object classes which have not been presented to the classifiers during training. For each classifier of the ensemble an individual feature set is determined from a total set of 98 features. Thereby, the overall classification performance can be improved when compared to previous methods and, additionally, novel classes can be identified much more accurately. Furthermore, the proposed structure allows to give new insights in the importance of features for the recognition of individual classes which is crucial for the development of new algorithms and sensor requirements. 

Title: A Benchmark for LiDAR-based Panoptic Segmentation based on KITTI
Abstract:  Panoptic segmentation is the recently introduced task that tackles semantic segmentation and instance segmentation jointly. In this paper, we present an extension of SemanticKITTI, which is a large-scale dataset providing dense point-wise semantic labels for all sequences of the KITTI Odometry Benchmark, for training and evaluation of laser-based panoptic segmentation. We provide the data and discuss the processing steps needed to enrich a given semantic annotation with temporally consistent instance information, i.e., instance information that supplements the semantic labels and identifies the same instance over sequences of LiDAR point clouds. Additionally, we present two strong baselines that combine state-of-the-art LiDAR-based semantic segmentation approaches with a state-of-the-art detector enriching the segmentation with instance information and that allow other researchers to compare their approaches against. We hope that our extension of SemanticKITTI with strong baselines enables the creation of novel algorithms for LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation as much as it has for the original semantic segmentation and semantic scene completion tasks. Data, code, and an online evaluation using a hidden test set will be published on http://semantic-kitti.org. 

Title: Learning Vision-based Cohesive Flight in Drone Swarms
Abstract:  This paper presents a data-driven approach to learning vision-based collective behavior from a simple flocking algorithm. We simulate a swarm of quadrotor drones and formulate the controller as a regression problem in which we generate 3D velocity commands directly from raw camera images. The dataset is created by simultaneously acquiring omnidirectional images and computing the corresponding control command from the flocking algorithm. We show that a convolutional neural network trained on the visual inputs of the drone can learn not only robust collision avoidance but also coherence of the flock in a sample-efficient manner. The neural controller effectively learns to localize other agents in the visual input, which we show by visualizing the regions with the most influence on the motion of an agent. This weakly supervised saliency map can be computed efficiently and may be used as a prior for subsequent detection and relative localization of other agents. We remove the dependence on sharing positions among flock members by taking only local visual information into account for control. Our work can therefore be seen as the first step towards a fully decentralized, vision-based flock without the need for communication or visual markers to aid detection of other agents. 

Title: Modeling Human Motion with Quaternion-based Neural Networks
Abstract:  Previous work on predicting or generating 3D human pose sequences regresses either joint rotations or joint positions. The former strategy is prone to error accumulation along the kinematic chain, as well as discontinuities when using Euler angles or exponential maps as parameterizations. The latter requires re-projection onto skeleton constraints to avoid bone stretching and invalid configurations. This work addresses both limitations. QuaterNet represents rotations with quaternions and our loss function performs forward kinematics on a skeleton to penalize absolute position errors instead of angle errors. We investigate both recurrent and convolutional architectures and evaluate on short-term prediction and long-term generation. For the latter, our approach is qualitatively judged as realistic as recent neural strategies from the graphics literature. Our experiments compare quaternions to Euler angles as well as exponential maps and show that only a very short context is required to make reliable future predictions. Finally, we show that the standard evaluation protocol for Human3.6M produces high variance results and we propose a simple solution. 

Title: Learning Precise 3D Manipulation from Multiple Uncalibrated Cameras
Abstract:  In this work, we present an effective multi-view approach to closed-loop end-to-end learning of precise manipulation tasks that are 3D in nature. Our method learns to accomplish these tasks using multiple statically placed but uncalibrated RGB camera views without building an explicit 3D representation such as a pointcloud or voxel grid. This multi-camera approach achieves superior task performance on difficult stacking and insertion tasks compared to single-view baselines. Single view robotic agents struggle from occlusion and challenges in estimating relative poses between points of interest. While full 3D scene representations (voxels or pointclouds) are obtainable from registered output of multiple depth sensors, several challenges complicate operating off such explicit 3D representations. These challenges include imperfect camera calibration, poor depth maps due to object properties such as reflective surfaces, and slower inference speeds over 3D representations compared to 2D images. Our use of static but uncalibrated cameras does not require camera-robot or camera-camera calibration making the proposed approach easy to setup and our use of \textit{sensor dropout} during training makes it resilient to the loss of camera-views after deployment. 

Title: Neural Architectures for Robot Intelligence
Abstract:  We argue that the direct experimental approaches to elucidate the architecture of higher brains may benefit from insights gained from exploring the possibilities and limits of artificial control architectures for robot systems. We present some of our recent work that has been motivated by that view and that is centered around the study of various aspects of hand actions since these are intimately linked with many higher cognitive abilities. As examples, we report on the development of a modular system for the recognition of continuous hand postures based on neural nets, the use of vision and tactile sensing for guiding prehensile movements of a multifingered hand, and the recognition and use of hand gestures for robot teaching. Regarding the issue of learning, we propose to view real-world learning from the perspective of data mining and to focus more strongly on the imitation of observed actions instead of purely reinforcement-based exploration. As a concrete example of such an effort we report on the status of an ongoing project in our lab in which a robot equipped with an attention system with a neurally inspired architecture is taught actions by using hand gestures in conjunction with speech commands. We point out some of the lessons learnt from this system, and discuss how systems of this kind can contribute to the study of issues at the junction between natural and artificial cognitive systems. 

Title: Joint Forward-Backward Visual Odometry for Stereo Cameras
Abstract:  Visual odometry is a widely used technique in the field of robotics and automation to keep a track on the location of a robot using visual cues alone. In this paper, we propose a joint forward backward visual odometry framework by combining both, the forward motion and backward motion estimated from stereo cameras. The basic framework of LIBVIOS2 is used here for pose estimation as it can run in real-time on standard CPUs. The complementary nature of errors in the forward and backward mode of visual odometry helps in providing a refined motion estimation upon combining these individual estimates. In addition, two reliability measures, that is, forward-backward relative pose error and forward-backward absolute pose error have been proposed for evaluating visual odometry frameworks on its own without the requirement of any ground truth data. The proposed scheme is evaluated on the KITTI visual odometry dataset. The experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy of the proposed scheme over the traditional odometry pipeline without much increase in the system overload. 

Title: Improving rigid 3D calibration for robotic surgery
Abstract:  Autonomy is the frontier of research in robotic surgery and its aim is to improve the quality of surgical procedures in the next future. One fundamental requirement for autonomy is advanced perception capability through vision sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration technique for a surgical scenario with da Vinci robot. Calibration of the camera and the robot is necessary for precise positioning of the tools in order to emulate the high performance surgeons. Our calibration technique is tailored for RGB-D camera. Different tests performed on relevant use cases for surgery prove that we significantly improve precision and accuracy with respect to the state of the art solutions for similar devices on a surgical-size setup. Moreover, our calibration method can be easily extended to standard surgical endoscope to prompt its use in real surgical scenario. 

Title: State-Only Imitation Learning for Dexterous Manipulation
Abstract:  Dexterous manipulation has been a long-standing challenge in robotics. Recently, modern model-free RL has demonstrated impressive results on a number of problems. However, complex domains like dexterous manipulation remain a challenge for RL due to the poor sample complexity. To address this, current approaches employ expert demonstrations in the form of state-action pairs, which are difficult to obtain for real-world settings such as learning from videos. In this work, we move toward a more realistic setting and explore state-only imitation learning. To tackle this setting, we train an inverse dynamics model and use it to predict actions for state-only demonstrations. The inverse dynamics model and the policy are trained jointly. Our method performs on par with state-action approaches and considerably outperforms RL alone. By not relying on expert actions, we are able to learn from demonstrations with different dynamics, morphologies, and objects. 

Title: Visual Imitation Made Easy
Abstract:  Visual imitation learning provides a framework for learning complex manipulation behaviors by leveraging human demonstrations. However, current interfaces for imitation such as kinesthetic teaching or teleoperation prohibitively restrict our ability to efficiently collect large-scale data in the wild. Obtaining such diverse demonstration data is paramount for the generalization of learned skills to novel scenarios. In this work, we present an alternate interface for imitation that simplifies the data collection process while allowing for easy transfer to robots. We use commercially available reacher-grabber assistive tools both as a data collection device and as the robot's end-effector. To extract action information from these visual demonstrations, we use off-the-shelf Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques in addition to training a finger detection network. We experimentally evaluate on two challenging tasks: non-prehensile pushing and prehensile stacking, with 1000 diverse demonstrations for each task. For both tasks, we use standard behavior cloning to learn executable policies from the previously collected offline demonstrations. To improve learning performance, we employ a variety of data augmentations and provide an extensive analysis of its effects. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our interface by evaluating on real robotic scenarios with previously unseen objects and achieve a 87% success rate on pushing and a 62% success rate on stacking. Robot videos are available at https://dhiraj100892.github.io/Visual-Imitation-Made-Easy. 

Title: eSLAM: An Energy-Efficient Accelerator for Real-Time ORB-SLAM on FPGA Platform
Abstract:  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a critical task for autonomous navigation. However, due to the computational complexity of SLAM algorithms, it is very difficult to achieve real-time implementation on low-power platforms.We propose an energy efficient architecture for real-time ORB (Oriented-FAST and Rotated- BRIEF) based visual SLAM system by accelerating the most time consuming stages of feature extraction and matching on FPGA platform.Moreover, the original ORB descriptor pattern is reformed as a rotational symmetric manner which is much more hardware friendly. Optimizations including rescheduling and parallelizing are further utilized to improve the throughput and reduce the memory footprint. Compared with Intel i7 and ARM Cortex-A9 CPUs on TUM dataset, our FPGA realization achieves up to 3X and 31X frame rate improvement, as well as up to 71X and 25X energy efficiency improvement, respectively. 

Title: Reduced egomotion estimation drift using omnidirectional views
Abstract:  Estimation of camera motion from a given image sequence becomes degraded as the length of the sequence increases. In this letter, this phenomenon is demonstrated and an approach to increase the estimation accuracy is proposed. The proposed method uses an omnidirectional camera in addition to the perspective one and takes advantage of its enlarged view by exploiting the correspondences between the omnidirectional and perspective images. Simulated and real image experiments show that the proposed approach improves the estimation accuracy. 

Title: Auto-conditioned Recurrent Mixture Density Networks for Learning Generalizable Robot Skills
Abstract:  Personal robots assisting humans must perform complex manipulation tasks that are typically difficult to specify in traditional motion planning pipelines, where multiple objectives must be met and the high-level context be taken into consideration. Learning from demonstration (LfD) provides a promising way to learn these kind of complex manipulation skills even from non-technical users. However, it is challenging for existing LfD methods to efficiently learn skills that can generalize to task specifications that are not covered by demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a state transition model (STM) that generates joint-space trajectories by imitating motions from expert behavior. Given a few demonstrations, we show in real robot experiments that the learned STM can quickly generalize to unseen tasks and synthesize motions having longer time horizons than the expert trajectories. Compared to conventional motion planners, our approach enables the robot to accomplish complex behaviors from high-level instructions without laborious hand-engineering of planning objectives, while being able to adapt to changing goals during the skill execution. In conjunction with a trajectory optimizer, our STM can construct a high-quality skeleton of a trajectory that can be further improved in smoothness and precision. In combination with a learned inverse dynamics model, we additionally present results where the STM is used as a high-level planner.

Title: Robot Perception enables Complex Navigation Behavior via Self-Supervised Learning
Abstract:  Learning visuomotor control policies in robotic systems is a fundamental problem when aiming for long-term behavioral autonomy. Recent supervised-learning-based vision and motion perception systems, however, are often separately built with limited capabilities, while being restricted to few behavioral skills such as passive visual odometry (VO) or mobile robot visual localization. Here we propose an approach to unify those successful robot perception systems for active target-driven navigation tasks via reinforcement learning (RL). Our method temporally incorporates compact motion and visual perception data - directly obtained using self-supervision from a single image sequence - to enable complex goal-oriented navigation skills. We demonstrate our approach on two real-world driving dataset, KITTI and Oxford RobotCar, using the new interactive CityLearn framework. The results show that our method can accurately generalize to extreme environmental changes such as day to night cycles with up to an 80% success rate, compared to 30% for a vision-only navigation systems. 

Title: TLIO: Tight Learned Inertial Odometry
Abstract:  In this work we propose a tightly-coupled Extended Kalman Filter framework for IMU-only state estimation. Strap-down IMU measurements provide relative state estimates based on IMU kinematic motion model. However the integration of measurements is sensitive to sensor bias and noise, causing significant drift within seconds. Recent research by Yan et al. (RoNIN) and Chen et al. (IONet) showed the capability of using trained neural networks to obtain accurate 2D displacement estimates from segments of IMU data and obtained good position estimates from concatenating them. This paper demonstrates a network that regresses 3D displacement estimates and its uncertainty, giving us the ability to tightly fuse the relative state measurement into a stochastic cloning EKF to solve for pose, velocity and sensor biases. We show that our network, trained with pedestrian data from a headset, can produce statistically consistent measurement and uncertainty to be used as the update step in the filter, and the tightly-coupled system outperforms velocity integration approaches in position estimates, and AHRS attitude filter in orientation estimates. 

Title: You Are Here: Geolocation by Embedding Maps and Images
Abstract:  We present a novel approach to geolocalising panoramic images on a 2-D cartographic map based on learning a low dimensional embedded space, which allows a comparison between an image captured at a location and local neighbourhoods of the map. The representation is not sufficiently discriminatory to allow localisation from a single image, but when concatenated along a route, localisation converges quickly, with over 90% accuracy being achieved for routes of around 200m in length when using Google Street View and Open Street Map data. The method generalises a previous fixed semantic feature based approach and achieves significantly higher localisation accuracy and faster convergence. 

Title: Unsupervised Learning of Depth and Ego-Motion from Cylindrical Panoramic Video
Abstract:  We introduce a convolutional neural network model for unsupervised learning of depth and ego-motion from cylindrical panoramic video. Panoramic depth estimation is an important technology for applications such as virtual reality, 3D modeling, and autonomous robotic navigation. In contrast to previous approaches for applying convolutional neural networks to panoramic imagery, we use the cylindrical panoramic projection which allows for the use of the traditional CNN layers such as convolutional filters and max pooling without modification. Our evaluation of synthetic and real data shows that unsupervised learning of depth and ego-motion on cylindrical panoramic images can produce high-quality depth maps and that an increased field-of-view improves ego-motion estimation accuracy. We also introduce Headcam, a novel dataset of panoramic video collected from a helmet-mounted camera while biking in an urban setting. 

Title: Learning Modular Neural Network Policies for Multi-Task and Multi-Robot Transfer
Abstract:  Reinforcement learning (RL) can automate a wide variety of robotic skills, but learning each new skill requires considerable real-world data collection and manual representation engineering to design policy classes or features. Using deep reinforcement learning to train general purpose neural network policies alleviates some of the burden of manual representation engineering by using expressive policy classes, but exacerbates the challenge of data collection, since such methods tend to be less efficient than RL with low-dimensional, hand-designed representations. Transfer learning can mitigate this problem by enabling us to transfer information from one skill to another and even from one robot to another. We show that neural network policies can be decomposed into "task-specific" and "robot-specific" modules, where the task-specific modules are shared across robots, and the robot-specific modules are shared across all tasks on that robot. This allows for sharing task information, such as perception, between robots and sharing robot information, such as dynamics and kinematics, between tasks. We exploit this decomposition to train mix-and-match modules that can solve new robot-task combinations that were not seen during training. Using a novel neural network architecture, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our transfer method for enabling zero-shot generalization with a variety of robots and tasks in simulation for both visual and non-visual tasks. 

Title: Virtual-to-Real-World Transfer Learning for Robots on Wilderness Trails
Abstract:  Robots hold promise in many scenarios involving outdoor use, such as search-and-rescue, wildlife management, and collecting data to improve environment, climate, and weather forecasting. However, autonomous navigation of outdoor trails remains a challenging problem. Recent work has sought to address this issue using deep learning. Although this approach has achieved state-of-the-art results, the deep learning paradigm may be limited due to a reliance on large amounts of annotated training data. Collecting and curating training datasets may not be feasible or practical in many situations, especially as trail conditions may change due to seasonal weather variations, storms, and natural erosion. In this paper, we explore an approach to address this issue through virtual-to-real-world transfer learning using a variety of deep learning models trained to classify the direction of a trail in an image. Our approach utilizes synthetic data gathered from virtual environments for model training, bypassing the need to collect a large amount of real images of the outdoors. We validate our approach in three main ways. First, we demonstrate that our models achieve classification accuracies upwards of 95% on our synthetic data set. Next, we utilize our classification models in the control system of a simulated robot to demonstrate feasibility. Finally, we evaluate our models on real-world trail data and demonstrate the potential of virtual-to-real-world transfer learning. 

Title: Saliency Guided Hierarchical Robust Visual Tracking
Abstract:  A saliency guided hierarchical visual tracking (SHT) algorithm containing global and local search phases is proposed in this paper. In global search, a top-down saliency model is novelly developed to handle abrupt motion and appearance variation problems. Nineteen feature maps are extracted first and combined with online learnt weights to produce the final saliency map and estimated target locations. After the evaluation of integration mechanism, the optimum candidate patch is passed to the local search. In local search, a superpixel based HSV histogram matching is performed jointly with an L2-RLS tracker to take both color distribution and holistic appearance feature of the object into consideration. Furthermore, a linear refinement search process with fast iterative solver is implemented to attenuate the possible negative influence of dominant particles. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted on a series of challenging image sequences. The superior performance of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art algorithms is demonstrated by comparative study. 

Title: Inferring 3D Articulated Models for Box Packaging Robot
Abstract:  Given a point cloud, we consider inferring kinematic models of 3D articulated objects such as boxes for the purpose of manipulating them. While previous work has shown how to extract a planar kinematic model (often represented as a linear chain), such planar models do not apply to 3D objects that are composed of segments often linked to the other segments in cyclic configurations. We present an approach for building a model that captures the relation between the input point cloud features and the object segment as well as the relation between the neighboring object segments. We use a conditional random field that allows us to model the dependencies between different segments of the object. We test our approach on inferring the kinematic structure from partial and noisy point cloud data for a wide variety of boxes including cake boxes, pizza boxes, and cardboard cartons of several sizes. The inferred structure enables our robot to successfully close these boxes by manipulating the flaps. 

Title: Estimating Metric Poses of Dynamic Objects Using Monocular Visual-Inertial Fusion
Abstract:  A monocular 3D object tracking system generally has only up-to-scale pose estimation results without any prior knowledge of the tracked object. In this paper, we propose a novel idea to recover the metric scale of an arbitrary dynamic object by optimizing the trajectory of the objects in the world frame, without motion assumptions. By introducing an additional constraint in the time domain, our monocular visual-inertial tracking system can obtain continuous six degree of freedom (6-DoF) pose estimation without scale ambiguity. Our method requires neither fixed multi-camera nor depth sensor settings for scale observability, instead, the IMU inside the monocular sensing suite provides scale information for both camera itself and the tracked object. We build the proposed system on top of our monocular visual-inertial system (VINS) to obtain accurate state estimation of the monocular camera in the world frame. The whole system consists of a 2D object tracker, an object region-based visual bundle adjustment (BA), VINS and a correlation analysis-based metric scale estimator. Experimental comparisons with ground truth demonstrate the tracking accuracy of our 3D tracking performance while a mobile augmented reality (AR) demo shows the feasibility of potential applications. 

Title: Cross-calibration of Time-of-flight and Colour Cameras
Abstract:  Time-of-flight cameras provide depth information, which is complementary to the photometric appearance of the scene in ordinary images. It is desirable to merge the depth and colour information, in order to obtain a coherent scene representation. However, the individual cameras will have different viewpoints, resolutions and fields of view, which means that they must be mutually calibrated. This paper presents a geometric framework for this multi-view and multi-modal calibration problem. It is shown that three-dimensional projective transformations can be used to align depth and parallax-based representations of the scene, with or without Euclidean reconstruction. A new evaluation procedure is also developed; this allows the reprojection error to be decomposed into calibration and sensor-dependent components. The complete approach is demonstrated on a network of three time-of-flight and six colour cameras. The applications of such a system, to a range of automatic scene-interpretation problems, are discussed. 

Title: A real-time analysis of rock fragmentation using UAV technology
Abstract:  Accurate measurement of blast-induced rock fragmentation is of great importance for many mining operations. The post-blast rock size distribution can significantly influence the efficiency of all the downstream mining and comminution processes. Image analysis methods are one of the most common methods used to measure rock fragment size distribution in mines regardless of criticism for lack of accuracy to measure fine particles and other perceived deficiencies. The current practice of collecting rock fragmentation data for image analysis is highly manual and provides data with low temporal and spatial resolution. Using UAVs for collecting images of rock fragments can not only improve the quality of the image data but also automate the data collection process. Ultimately, real-time acquisition of high temporal- and spatial-resolution data based on UAV technology will provide a broad range of opportunities for both improving blast design without interrupting the production process and reducing the cost of the human operator. This paper presents the results of a series of laboratory-scale rock fragment measurements using a quadrotor UAV equipped with a camera. The goal of this work is to highlight the benefits of aerial fragmentation analysis in terms of both prediction accuracy and time effort. A pile of rock fragments with different fragment sizes was placed in a lab that is equipped with a motion capture camera system for precise UAV localization and control. Such an environment presents optimal conditions for UAV flight and thus, is well-suited for conducting proof-of-concept experiments before testing them in large-scale field experiments. The pile was photographed by a camera attached to the UAV, and the particle size distribution curves were generated in almost real-time. The pile was also manually photographed and the results of the manual method were compared to the UAV method. 

Title: Iterative Hough Forest with Histogram of Control Points for 6 DoF Object Registration from Depth Images
Abstract:  State-of-the-art techniques proposed for 6D object pose recovery depend on occlusion-free point clouds to accurately register objects in 3D space. To reduce this dependency, we introduce a novel architecture called Iterative Hough Forest with Histogram of Control Points that is capable of estimating occluded and cluttered objects' 6D pose given a candidate 2D bounding box. Our Iterative Hough Forest is learnt using patches extracted only from the positive samples. These patches are represented with Histogram of Control Points (HoCP), a "scale-variant" implicit volumetric description, which we derive from recently introduced Implicit B-Splines (IBS). The rich discriminative information provided by this scale-variance is leveraged during inference, where the initial pose estimation of the object is iteratively refined based on more discriminative control points by using our Iterative Hough Forest. We conduct experiments on several test objects of a publicly available dataset to test our architecture and to compare with the state-of-the-art. 

Title: Intelligent Roundabout Insertion using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  An important topic in the autonomous driving research is the development of maneuver planning systems. Vehicles have to interact and negotiate with each other so that optimal choices, in terms of time and safety, are taken. For this purpose, we present a maneuver planning module able to negotiate the entering in busy roundabouts. The proposed module is based on a neural network trained to predict when and how entering the roundabout throughout the whole duration of the maneuver. Our model is trained with a novel implementation of A3C, which we will call Delayed A3C (D-A3C), in a synthetic environment where vehicles move in a realistic manner with interaction capabilities. In addition, the system is trained such that agents feature a unique tunable behavior, emulating real world scenarios where drivers have their own driving styles. Similarly, the maneuver can be performed using different aggressiveness levels, which is particularly useful to manage busy scenarios where conservative rule-based policies would result in undefined waits. 

Title: Model-Free Trajectory-based Policy Optimization with Monotonic Improvement
Abstract:  Many of the recent trajectory optimization algorithms alternate between linear approximation of the system dynamics around the mean trajectory and conservative policy update. One way of constraining the policy change is by bounding the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between successive policies. These approaches already demonstrated great experimental success in challenging problems such as end-to-end control of physical systems. However, the linear approximation of the system dynamics can introduce a bias in the policy update and prevent convergence to the optimal policy. In this article, we propose a new model-free trajectory-based policy optimization algorithm with guaranteed monotonic improvement. The algorithm backpropagates a local, quadratic and time-dependent \qfunc~learned from trajectory data instead of a model of the system dynamics. Our policy update ensures exact KL-constraint satisfaction without simplifying assumptions on the system dynamics. We experimentally demonstrate on highly non-linear control tasks the improvement in performance of our algorithm in comparison to approaches linearizing the system dynamics. In order to show the monotonic improvement of our algorithm, we additionally conduct a theoretical analysis of our policy update scheme to derive a lower bound of the change in policy return between successive iterations. 

Title: On Simple Reactive Neural Networks for Behaviour-Based Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  We present a behaviour-based reinforcement learning approach, inspired by Brook's subsumption architecture, in which simple fully connected networks are trained as reactive behaviours. Our working assumption is that a pick and place robotic task can be simplified by leveraging domain knowledge of a robotics developer to decompose and train such reactive behaviours; namely, approach, grasp, and retract. Then the robot autonomously learns how to combine them via an Actor-Critic architecture. The Actor-Critic policy is to determine the activation and inhibition mechanisms of the reactive behaviours in a particular temporal sequence. We validate our approach in a simulated robot environment where the task is picking a block and taking it to a target position while orienting the gripper from a top grasp. The latter represents an extra degree-of-freedom of which current end-to-end reinforcement learning fail to generalise. Our findings suggest that robotic learning can be more effective if each behaviour is learnt in isolation and then combined them to accomplish the task. That is, our approach learns the pick and place task in 8,000 episodes, which represents a drastic reduction in the number of training episodes required by an end-to-end approach and the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. 

Title: Monocular 3D Object Detection and Box Fitting Trained End-to-End Using Intersection-over-Union Loss
Abstract:  Three-dimensional object detection from a single view is a challenging task which, if performed with good accuracy, is an important enabler of low-cost mobile robot perception. Previous approaches to this problem suffer either from an overly complex inference engine or from an insufficient detection accuracy. To deal with these issues, we present SS3D, a single-stage monocular 3D object detector. The framework consists of (i) a CNN, which outputs a redundant representation of each relevant object in the image with corresponding uncertainty estimates, and (ii) a 3D bounding box optimizer. We show how modeling heteroscedastic uncertainty improves performance upon our baseline, and furthermore, how back-propagation can be done through the optimizer in order to train the pipeline end-to-end for additional accuracy. Our method achieves SOTA accuracy on monocular 3D object detection, while running at 20 fps in a straightforward implementation. We argue that the SS3D architecture provides a solid framework upon which high performing detection systems can be built, with autonomous driving being the main application in mind. 

Title: Deep Learning for Robotic Mass Transport Cloaking
Abstract:  We consider the problem of mass transport cloaking using mobile robots. The robots move along a predefined curve that encloses a safe zone and carry sources that collectively counteract a chemical agent released in the environment. The goal is to steer the mass flux around a desired region so that it remains unaffected by the external concentration. We formulate the problem of controlling the robot positions and release rates as a PDE-constrained optimization, where the propagation of the chemical is modeled by the advection-diffusion (AD) PDE. We use a neural network (NN) to approximate the solution of the PDE. Particularly, we propose a novel loss function for the NN that utilizes the variational form of the AD-PDE and allows us to reformulate the planning problem as an unsupervised model-based learning problem. Our loss function is discretization-free and highly parallelizable. Unlike passive cloaking methods that use metamaterials to steer the mass flux, our method is the first to use mobile robots to actively control the concentration levels and create safe zones independent of environmental conditions. We demonstrate the performance of our method in simulations. 

Title: FANTrack: 3D Multi-Object Tracking with Feature Association Network
Abstract:  We propose a data-driven approach to online multi-object tracking (MOT) that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for data association in a tracking-by-detection framework. The problem of multi-target tracking aims to assign noisy detections to a-priori unknown and time-varying number of tracked objects across a sequence of frames. A majority of the existing solutions focus on either tediously designing cost functions or formulating the task of data association as a complex optimization problem that can be solved effectively. Instead, we exploit the power of deep learning to formulate the data association problem as inference in a CNN. To this end, we propose to learn a similarity function that combines cues from both image and spatial features of objects. Our solution learns to perform global assignments in 3D purely from data, handles noisy detections and a varying number of targets, and is easy to train. We evaluate our approach on the challenging KITTI dataset and show competitive results. Our code is available at https://git.uwaterloo.ca/wise-lab/fantrack. 

Title: Map-based Multi-Policy Reinforcement Learning: Enhancing Adaptability of Robots by Deep Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  In order for robots to perform mission-critical tasks, it is essential that they are able to quickly adapt to changes in their environment as well as to injuries and or other bodily changes. Deep reinforcement learning has been shown to be successful in training robot control policies for operation in complex environments. However, existing methods typically employ only a single policy. This can limit the adaptability since a large environmental modification might require a completely different behavior compared to the learning environment. To solve this problem, we propose Map-based Multi-Policy Reinforcement Learning (MMPRL), which aims to search and store multiple policies that encode different behavioral features while maximizing the expected reward in advance of the environment change. Thanks to these policies, which are stored into a multi-dimensional discrete map according to its behavioral feature, adaptation can be performed within reasonable time without retraining the robot. An appropriate pre-trained policy from the map can be recalled using Bayesian optimization. Our experiments show that MMPRL enables robots to quickly adapt to large changes without requiring any prior knowledge on the type of injuries that could occur. A highlight of the learned behaviors can be found here: https://youtu.be/QwInbilXNOE . 

Title: Comparison of Distal Teacher Learning with Numerical and Analytical Methods to Solve Inverse Kinematics for Rigid-Body Mechanisms
Abstract:  Several publications are concerned with learning inverse kinematics, however, their evaluation is often limited and none of the proposed methods is of practical relevance for rigid-body kinematics with a known forward model. We argue that for rigid-body kinematics one of the first proposed machine learning (ML) solutions to inverse kinematics -- distal teaching (DT) -- is actually good enough when combined with differentiable programming libraries and we provide an extensive evaluation and comparison to analytical and numerical solutions. In particular, we analyze solve rate, accuracy, sample efficiency and scalability. Further, we study how DT handles joint limits, singularities, unreachable poses, trajectories and provide a comparison of execution times. The three approaches are evaluated on three different rigid body mechanisms with varying complexity. With enough training data and relaxed precision requirements, DT has a better solve rate and is faster than state-of-the-art numerical solvers for a 15-DoF mechanism. DT is not affected by singularities while numerical solutions are vulnerable to them. In all other cases numerical solutions are usually better. Analytical solutions outperform the other approaches by far if they are available. 

Title: Improving Robot Dual-System Motor Learning with Intrinsically Motivated Meta-Control and Latent-Space Experience Imagination
Abstract:  Combining model-based and model-free learning systems has been shown to improve the sample efficiency of learning to perform complex robotic tasks. However, dual-system approaches fail to consider the reliability of the learned model when it is applied to make multiple-step predictions, resulting in a compounding of prediction errors and performance degradation. In this paper, we present a novel dual-system motor learning approach where a meta-controller arbitrates online between model-based and model-free decisions based on an estimate of the local reliability of the learned model. The reliability estimate is used in computing an intrinsic feedback signal, encouraging actions that lead to data that improves the model. Our approach also integrates arbitration with imagination where a learned latent-space model generates imagined experiences, based on its local reliability, to be used as additional training data. We evaluate our approach against baseline and state-of-the-art methods on learning vision-based robotic grasping in simulation and real world. The results show that our approach outperforms the compared methods and learns near-optimal grasping policies in dense- and sparse-reward environments. 

Title: Adaptive Game-Theoretic Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicle Control at Roundabouts
Abstract:  In this paper, we propose a decision making algorithm for autonomous vehicle control at a roundabout intersection. The algorithm is based on a game-theoretic model representing the interactions between the ego vehicle and an opponent vehicle, and adapts to an online estimated driver type of the opponent vehicle. Simulation results are reported. 

Title: Multi-view registration of unordered range scans by fast correspondence propagation of multi-scale descriptors
Abstract:  This paper proposes a global approach for the multi-view registration of unordered range scans. As the basis of multi-view registration, pair-wise registration is very pivotal. Therefore, we first select a good descriptor and accelerate its correspondence propagation for the pair-wise registration. Then, we design an effective rule to judge the reliability of pair-wise registration results. Subsequently, we propose a model augmentation method, which can utilize reliable results of pair-wise registration to augment the model shape. Finally, multi-view registration can be accomplished by operating the pair-wise registration and judgment, and model augmentation alternately. Experimental results on public available data sets show, that this approach can automatically achieve the multi-view registration of unordered range scans with good accuracy and effectiveness. 

Title: Joint Attention in Driver-Pedestrian Interaction: from Theory to Practice
Abstract:  Today, one of the major challenges that autonomous vehicles are facing is the ability to drive in urban environments. Such a task requires communication between autonomous vehicles and other road users in order to resolve various traffic ambiguities. The interaction between road users is a form of negotiation in which the parties involved have to share their attention regarding a common objective or a goal (e.g. crossing an intersection), and coordinate their actions in order to accomplish it. In this literature review we aim to address the interaction problem between pedestrians and drivers (or vehicles) from joint attention point of view. More specifically, we will discuss the theoretical background behind joint attention, its application to traffic interaction and practical approaches to implementing joint attention for autonomous vehicles. 

Title: More Than a Feeling: Learning to Grasp and Regrasp using Vision and Touch
Abstract:  For humans, the process of grasping an object relies heavily on rich tactile feedback. Most recent robotic grasping work, however, has been based only on visual input, and thus cannot easily benefit from feedback after initiating contact. In this paper, we investigate how a robot can learn to use tactile information to iteratively and efficiently adjust its grasp. To this end, we propose an end-to-end action-conditional model that learns regrasping policies from raw visuo-tactile data. This model -- a deep, multimodal convolutional network -- predicts the outcome of a candidate grasp adjustment, and then executes a grasp by iteratively selecting the most promising actions. Our approach requires neither calibration of the tactile sensors, nor any analytical modeling of contact forces, thus reducing the engineering effort required to obtain efficient grasping policies. We train our model with data from about 6,450 grasping trials on a two-finger gripper equipped with GelSight high-resolution tactile sensors on each finger. Across extensive experiments, our approach outperforms a variety of baselines at (i) estimating grasp adjustment outcomes, (ii) selecting efficient grasp adjustments for quick grasping, and (iii) reducing the amount of force applied at the fingers, while maintaining competitive performance. Finally, we study the choices made by our model and show that it has successfully acquired useful and interpretable grasping behaviors. 

Title: Generic 3D Representation via Pose Estimation and Matching
Abstract:  Though a large body of computer vision research has investigated developing generic semantic representations, efforts towards developing a similar representation for 3D has been limited. In this paper, we learn a generic 3D representation through solving a set of foundational proxy 3D tasks: object-centric camera pose estimation and wide baseline feature matching. Our method is based upon the premise that by providing supervision over a set of carefully selected foundational tasks, generalization to novel tasks and abstraction capabilities can be achieved. We empirically show that the internal representation of a multi-task ConvNet trained to solve the above core problems generalizes to novel 3D tasks (e.g., scene layout estimation, object pose estimation, surface normal estimation) without the need for fine-tuning and shows traits of abstraction abilities (e.g., cross-modality pose estimation). In the context of the core supervised tasks, we demonstrate our representation achieves state-of-the-art wide baseline feature matching results without requiring apriori rectification (unlike SIFT and the majority of learned features). We also show 6DOF camera pose estimation given a pair local image patches. The accuracy of both supervised tasks come comparable to humans. Finally, we contribute a large-scale dataset composed of object-centric street view scenes along with point correspondences and camera pose information, and conclude with a discussion on the learned representation and open research questions. 

Title: Long-Range Indoor Navigation with PRM-RL
Abstract:  Long-range indoor navigation requires guiding robots with noisy sensors and controls through cluttered environments along paths that span a variety of buildings. We achieve this with PRM-RL, a hierarchical robot navigation method in which reinforcement learning agents that map noisy sensors to robot controls learn to solve short-range obstacle avoidance tasks, and then sampling-based planners map where these agents can reliably navigate in simulation; these roadmaps and agents are then deployed on robots, guiding them along the shortest path where the agents are likely to succeed. Here we use Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRMs) as the sampling-based planner, and AutoRL as the reinforcement learning method in the indoor navigation context. We evaluate the method in simulation for kinematic differential drive and kinodynamic car-like robots in several environments, and on differential-drive robots at three physical sites. Our results show PRM-RL with AutoRL is more successful than several baselines, is robust to noise, and can guide robots over hundreds of meters in the face of noise and obstacles in both simulation and on robots, including over 5.8 kilometers of physical robot navigation.

Title: Information-theoretic Model Identification and Policy Search using Physics Engines with Application to Robotic Manipulation
Abstract:  We consider the problem of a robot learning the mechanical properties of objects through physical interaction with the object, and introduce a practical, data-efficient approach for identifying the motion models of these objects. The proposed method utilizes a physics engine, where the robot seeks to identify the inertial and friction parameters of the object by simulating its motion under different values of the parameters and identifying those that result in a simulation which matches the observed real motions. The problem is solved in a Bayesian optimization framework. The same framework is used for both identifying the model of an object online and searching for a policy that would minimize a given cost function according to the identified model. Experimental results both in simulation and using a real robot indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art model-free reinforcement learning approaches. 

Title: Watch This: Scalable Cost-Function Learning for Path Planning in Urban Environments
Abstract:  In this work, we present an approach to learn cost maps for driving in complex urban environments from a very large number of demonstrations of driving behaviour by human experts. The learned cost maps are constructed directly from raw sensor measurements, bypassing the effort of manually designing cost maps as well as features. When deploying the learned cost maps, the trajectories generated not only replicate human-like driving behaviour but are also demonstrably robust against systematic errors in putative robot configuration. To achieve this we deploy a Maximum Entropy based, non-linear IRL framework which uses Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs) to represent the cost model underlying expert driving behaviour. Using a deep, parametric approach enables us to scale efficiently to large datasets and complex behaviours by being run-time independent of dataset extent during deployment. We demonstrate the scalability and the performance of the proposed approach on an ambitious dataset collected over the course of one year including more than 25k demonstration trajectories extracted from over 120km of driving around pedestrianised areas in the city of Milton Keynes, UK. We evaluate the resulting cost representations by showing the advantages over a carefully manually designed cost map and, in addition, demonstrate its robustness to systematic errors by learning precise cost-maps even in the presence of system calibration perturbations. 

Title: Spatially-Aware Graph Neural Networks for Relational Behavior Forecasting from Sensor Data
Abstract:  In this paper, we tackle the problem of relational behavior forecasting from sensor data. Towards this goal, we propose a novel spatially-aware graph neural network (SpAGNN) that models the interactions between agents in the scene. Specifically, we exploit a convolutional neural network to detect the actors and compute their initial states. A graph neural network then iteratively updates the actor states via a message passing process. Inspired by Gaussian belief propagation, we design the messages to be spatially-transformed parameters of the output distributions from neighboring agents. Our model is fully differentiable, thus enabling end-to-end training. Importantly, our probabilistic predictions can model uncertainty at the trajectory level. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on two real-world self-driving datasets: ATG4D and nuScenes. 

Title: A Dataset for Evaluating Multi-spectral Motion Estimation Methods
Abstract:  Visible images have been widely used for indoor motion estimation. Thermal images, in contrast, are more challenging to be used in motion estimation since they typically have lower resolution, less texture, and more noise. In this paper, a novel dataset for evaluating the performance of multi-spectral motion estimation systems is presented. The dataset includes both multi-spectral and dense depth images with accurate ground-truth camera poses provided by a motion capture system. All the sequences are recorded from a handheld multi-spectral device, which consists of a standard visible-light camera, a long-wave infrared camera, and a depth camera. The multi-spectral images, including both color and thermal images in full sensor resolution (640 $\times$ 480), are obtained from the hardware-synchronized standard and long-wave infrared camera at 32Hz. The depth images are captured by a Microsoft Kinect2 and can have benefits for learning cross-modalities stereo matching. In addition to the sequences with bright illumination, the dataset also contains scenes with dim or varying illumination. The full dataset, including both raw data and calibration data with detailed specifications of data format, is publicly available. 

Title: NeurAll: Towards a Unified Model for Visual Perception in Automated Driving
Abstract:  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are successfully used for the important automotive visual perception tasks including object recognition, motion and depth estimation, visual SLAM, etc. However, these tasks are typically independently explored and modeled. In this paper, we propose a joint multi-task network design for learning several tasks simultaneously. Our main motivation is the computational efficiency achieved by sharing the expensive initial convolutional layers between all tasks. Indeed, the main bottleneck in automated driving systems is the limited processing power available on deployment hardware. There is also some evidence for other benefits in improving accuracy for some tasks and easing development effort. It also offers scalability to add more tasks leveraging existing features and achieving better generalization. We survey various CNN based solutions for visual perception tasks in automated driving. Then we propose a unified CNN model for the important tasks and discuss several advanced optimization and architecture design techniques to improve the baseline model. The paper is partly review and partly positional with demonstration of several preliminary results promising for future research. We first demonstrate results of multi-stream learning and auxiliary learning which are important ingredients to scale to a large multi-task model. Finally, we implement a two-stream three-task network which performs better in many cases compared to their corresponding single-task models, while maintaining network size. 

Title: Learning User Preferences for Trajectories from Brain Signals
Abstract:  Robot motions in the presence of humans should not only be feasible and safe, but also conform to human preferences. This, however, requires user feedback on the robot's behavior. In this work, we propose a novel approach to leverage the user's brain signals as a feedback modality in order to decode the judgment of robot trajectories and rank them according to the user's preferences. We show that brain signals measured using electroencephalography during observation of a robotic arm's trajectory as well as in response to preference statements are informative regarding the user's preference. Furthermore, we demonstrate that user feedback from brain signals can be used to reliably infer pairwise trajectory preferences as well as to retrieve the preferred observed trajectories of the user with a performance comparable to explicit behavioral feedback. 

Title: Sim-to-Real Learning for Casualty Detection from Ground Projected Point Cloud Data
Abstract:  This paper addresses the problem of human body detection---particularly a human body lying on the ground (a.k.a. casualty)---using point cloud data. This ability to detect a casualty is one of the most important features of mobile rescue robots, in order for them to be able to operate autonomously. We propose a deep-learning-based casualty detection method using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). This network is trained to be able to detect a casualty using a point-cloud data input. In the method we propose, the point cloud input is pre-processed to generate a depth image-like ground-projected heightmap. This heightmap is generated based on the projected distance of each point onto the detected ground plane within the point cloud data. The generated heightmap -- in image form -- is then used as an input for the CNN to detect a human body lying on the ground. To train the neural network, we propose a novel sim-to-real approach, in which the network model is trained using synthetic data obtained in simulation and then tested on real sensor data. To make the model transferable to real data implementations, during the training we adopt specific data augmentation strategies with the synthetic training data. The experimental results show that data augmentation introduced during the training process is essential for improving the performance of the trained model on real data. More specifically, the results demonstrate that the data augmentations on raw point-cloud data have contributed to a considerable improvement of the trained model performance. 

Title: Self-Supervised Object-in-Gripper Segmentation from Robotic Motions
Abstract:  We present a novel technique to automatically generate annotated data for important robotic perception tasks such as object segmentation and 3D object reconstruction using a robot manipulator. Our self-supervised method can segment unknown objects from a robotic gripper in RGB video sequences by exploiting motion and temporal cues. The key aspect of our approach in contrast to existing systems is its independence of any hardware specifics such as extrinsic and intrinsic camera calibration and a robot model. We achieve this using a two-step process: First, we learn to predict segmentation masks for our given manipulator using optical flow estimation. Then, these masks are used in combination with motion cues to automatically distinguish between the manipulator, the background, and the unknown, grasped object. We perform a thorough comparison with alternative baselines and approaches in the literature. The obtained object views and masks are suitable training data for segmentation networks that generalize to novel environments and also allow for watertight 3D object reconstruction. 

Title: Constrained-Space Optimization and Reinforcement Learning for Complex Tasks
Abstract:  Learning from Demonstration is increasingly used for transferring operator manipulation skills to robots. In practice, it is important to cater for limited data and imperfect human demonstrations, as well as underlying safety constraints. This paper presents a constrained-space optimization and reinforcement learning scheme for managing complex tasks. Through interactions within the constrained space, the reinforcement learning agent is trained to optimize the manipulation skills according to a defined reward function. After learning, the optimal policy is derived from the well-trained reinforcement learning agent, which is then implemented to guide the robot to conduct tasks that are similar to the experts' demonstrations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with a robotic suturing task, demonstrating that the learned policy outperformed the experts' demonstrations in terms of the smoothness of the joint motion and end-effector trajectories, as well as the overall task completion time. 

Title: Robot Imitation through Vision, Kinesthetic and Force Features with Online Adaptation to Changing Environments
Abstract:  Continuous Goal-Directed Actions (CGDA) is a robot imitation framework that encodes actions as the changes they produce on the environment. While it presents numerous advantages with respect to other robot imitation frameworks in terms of generalization and portability, final robot joint trajectories for the execution of actions are not necessarily encoded within the model. This is studied as an optimization problem, and the solution is computed through evolutionary algorithms in simulated environments. Evolutionary algorithms require a large number of evaluations, which had made the use of these algorithms in real world applications very challenging. This paper presents online evolutionary strategies, as a change of paradigm within CGDA execution. Online evolutionary strategies shift and merge motor execution into the planning loop. A concrete online evolutionary strategy, Online Evolved Trajectories (OET), is presented. OET drastically reduces computational times between motor executions, and enables working in real world dynamic environments and/or with human collaboration. Its performance has been measured against Full Trajectory Evolution (FTE) and Incrementally Evolved Trajectories (IET), obtaining the best overall results. Experimental evaluations are performed on the TEO full-sized humanoid robot with "paint" and "iron" actions that together involve vision, kinesthetic and force features. 

Title: Deep Rigid Instance Scene Flow
Abstract:  In this paper we tackle the problem of scene flow estimation in the context of self-driving. We leverage deep learning techniques as well as strong priors as in our application domain the motion of the scene can be composed by the motion of the robot and the 3D motion of the actors in the scene. We formulate the problem as energy minimization in a deep structured model, which can be solved efficiently in the GPU by unrolling a Gaussian-Newton solver. Our experiments in the challenging KITTI scene flow dataset show that we outperform the state-of-the-art by a very large margin, while being 800 times faster. 

Title: Distributed Mapping with Privacy and Communication Constraints: Lightweight Algorithms and Object-based Models
Abstract:  We consider the following problem: a team of robots is deployed in an unknown environment and it has to collaboratively build a map of the area without a reliable infrastructure for communication. The backbone for modern mapping techniques is pose graph optimization, which estimates the trajectory of the robots, from which the map can be easily built. The first contribution of this paper is a set of distributed algorithms for pose graph optimization: rather than sending all sensor data to a remote sensor fusion server, the robots exchange very partial and noisy information to reach an agreement on the pose graph configuration. Our approach can be considered as a distributed implementation of the two-stage approach of Carlone et al., where we use the Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) and the Jacobi Over-Relaxation (JOR) as workhorses to split the computation among the robots. As a second contribution, we extend %and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed distributed algorithms to work with object-based map models. The use of object-based models avoids the exchange of raw sensor measurements (e.g., point clouds) further reducing the communication burden. Our third contribution is an extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques, including tests in realistic Gazebo simulations and field experiments in a military test facility. Abundant experimental evidence suggests that one of the proposed algorithms (the Distributed Gauss-Seidel method or DGS) has excellent performance. The DGS requires minimal information exchange, has an anytime flavor, scales well to large teams, is robust to noise, and is easy to implement. Our field tests show that the combined use of our distributed algorithms and object-based models reduces the communication requirements by several orders of magnitude and enables distributed mapping with large teams of robots in real-world problems. 

Title: Learning to Play Soccer by Reinforcement and Applying Sim-to-Real to Compete in the Real World
Abstract:  This work presents an application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the complete control of real soccer robots of the IEEE Very Small Size Soccer (VSSS), a traditional league in the Latin American Robotics Competition (LARC). In the VSSS league, two teams of three small robots play against each other. We propose a simulated environment in which continuous or discrete control policies can be trained, and a Sim-to-Real method to allow using the obtained policies to control a robot in the real world. The results show that the learned policies display a broad repertoire of behaviors that are difficult to specify by hand. This approach, called VSSS-RL, was able to beat the human-designed policy for the striker of the team ranked 3rd place in the 2018 LARC, in 1-vs-1 matches. 

Title: Learning better generative models for dexterous, single-view grasping of novel objects
Abstract:  This paper concerns the problem of how to learn to grasp dexterously, so as to be able to then grasp novel objects seen only from a single view-point. Recently, progress has been made in data-efficient learning of generative grasp models which transfer well to novel objects. These generative grasp models are learned from demonstration (LfD). One weakness is that, as this paper shall show, grasp transfer under challenging single view conditions is unreliable. Second, the number of generative model elements rises linearly in the number of training examples. This, in turn, limits the potential of these generative models for generalisation and continual improvement. In this paper, it is shown how to address these problems. Several technical contributions are made: (i) a view-based model of a grasp; (ii) a method for combining and compressing multiple grasp models; (iii) a new way of evaluating contacts that is used both to generate and to score grasps. These, together, improve both grasp performance and reduce the number of models learned for grasp transfer. These advances, in turn, also allow the introduction of autonomous training, in which the robot learns from self-generated grasps. Evaluation on a challenging test set shows that, with innovations (i)-(iii) deployed, grasp transfer success rises from 55.1% to 81.6%. By adding autonomous training this rises to 87.8%. These differences are statistically significant. In total, across all experiments, 539 test grasps were executed on real objects. 

Title: Multi-view Self-supervised Deep Learning for 6D Pose Estimation in the Amazon Picking Challenge
Abstract:  Robot warehouse automation has attracted significant interest in recent years, perhaps most visibly in the Amazon Picking Challenge (APC). A fully autonomous warehouse pick-and-place system requires robust vision that reliably recognizes and locates objects amid cluttered environments, self-occlusions, sensor noise, and a large variety of objects. In this paper we present an approach that leverages multi-view RGB-D data and self-supervised, data-driven learning to overcome those difficulties. The approach was part of the MIT-Princeton Team system that took 3rd- and 4th- place in the stowing and picking tasks, respectively at APC 2016. In the proposed approach, we segment and label multiple views of a scene with a fully convolutional neural network, and then fit pre-scanned 3D object models to the resulting segmentation to get the 6D object pose. Training a deep neural network for segmentation typically requires a large amount of training data. We propose a self-supervised method to generate a large labeled dataset without tedious manual segmentation. We demonstrate that our system can reliably estimate the 6D pose of objects under a variety of scenarios. All code, data, and benchmarks are available at http://apc.cs.princeton.edu/ 

Title: Deep Learning Tubes for Tube MPC
Abstract:  Learning-based control aims to construct models of a system to use for planning or trajectory optimization, e.g. in model-based reinforcement learning. In order to obtain guarantees of safety in this context, uncertainty must be accurately quantified. This uncertainty may come from errors in learning (due to a lack of data, for example), or may be inherent to the system. Propagating uncertainty forward in learned dynamics models is a difficult problem. In this work we use deep learning to obtain expressive and flexible models of how distributions of trajectories behave, which we then use for nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC). We introduce a deep quantile regression framework for control that enforces probabilistic quantile bounds and quantifies epistemic uncertainty. Using our method we explore three different approaches for learning tubes that contain the possible trajectories of the system, and demonstrate how to use each of them in a Tube MPC scheme. We prove these schemes are recursively feasible and satisfy constraints with a desired margin of probability. We present experiments in simulation on a nonlinear quadrotor system, demonstrating the practical efficacy of these ideas. 

Title: Direct Sparse Mapping
Abstract:  Photometric bundle adjustment, PBA, accurately estimates geometry from video. However, current PBA systems have a temporary map that cannot manage scene reobservations. We present, DSM, a full monocular visual SLAM based on PBA. Its persistent map handles reobservations, yielding the most accurate results up to date on EuRoC for a direct method. 

Title: PRECOG: PREdiction Conditioned On Goals in Visual Multi-Agent Settings
Abstract:  For autonomous vehicles (AVs) to behave appropriately on roads populated by human-driven vehicles, they must be able to reason about the uncertain intentions and decisions of other drivers from rich perceptual information. Towards these capabilities, we present a probabilistic forecasting model of future interactions between a variable number of agents. We perform both standard forecasting and the novel task of conditional forecasting, which reasons about how all agents will likely respond to the goal of a controlled agent (here, the AV). We train models on real and simulated data to forecast vehicle trajectories given past positions and LIDAR. Our evaluation shows that our model is substantially more accurate in multi-agent driving scenarios compared to existing state-of-the-art. Beyond its general ability to perform conditional forecasting queries, we show that our model's predictions of all agents improve when conditioned on knowledge of the AV's goal, further illustrating its capability to model agent interactions. 

Title: Human Posture Recognition and Gesture Imitation with a Humanoid Robot
Abstract:  This study proposes different approaches for static and dynamic gesture analysis and imitation with the social robot Nao 

Title: Maximum a Posteriori Policy Optimisation
Abstract:  We introduce a new algorithm for reinforcement learning called Maximum aposteriori Policy Optimisation (MPO) based on coordinate ascent on a relative entropy objective. We show that several existing methods can directly be related to our derivation. We develop two off-policy algorithms and demonstrate that they are competitive with the state-of-the-art in deep reinforcement learning. In particular, for continuous control, our method outperforms existing methods with respect to sample efficiency, premature convergence and robustness to hyperparameter settings while achieving similar or better final performance. 

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Industrial Insertion Tasks with Visual Inputs and Natural Rewards
Abstract:  Connector insertion and many other tasks commonly found in modern manufacturing settings involve complex contact dynamics and friction. Since it is difficult to capture related physical effects with first-order modeling, traditional control methods often result in brittle and inaccurate controllers, which have to be manually tuned. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been demonstrated to be capable of learning controllers in such environments from autonomous interaction with the environment, but running RL algorithms in the real world poses sample efficiency and safety challenges. Moreover, in practical real-world settings we cannot assume access to perfect state information or dense reward signals. In this paper, we consider a variety of difficult industrial insertion tasks with visual inputs and different natural reward specifications, namely sparse rewards and goal images. We show that methods that combine RL with prior information, such as classical controllers or demonstrations, can solve these tasks from a reasonable amount of real-world interaction. 

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning with Successor Features for Navigation across Similar Environments
Abstract:  In this paper we consider the problem of robot navigation in simple maze-like environments where the robot has to rely on its onboard sensors to perform the navigation task. In particular, we are interested in solutions to this problem that do not require localization, mapping or planning. Additionally, we require that our solution can quickly adapt to new situations (e.g., changing navigation goals and environments). To meet these criteria we frame this problem as a sequence of related reinforcement learning tasks. We propose a successor feature based deep reinforcement learning algorithm that can learn to transfer knowledge from previously mastered navigation tasks to new problem instances. Our algorithm substantially decreases the required learning time after the first task instance has been solved, which makes it easily adaptable to changing environments. We validate our method in both simulated and real robot experiments with a Robotino and compare it to a set of baseline methods including classical planning-based navigation. 

Title: Predicting Sample Collision with Neural Networks
Abstract:  Many state-of-art robotics applications require fast and efficient motion planning algorithms. Existing motion planning methods become less effective as the dimensionality of the robot and its workspace increases, especially the computational cost of collision detection routines. In this work, we present a framework to address the cost of expensive primitive operations in sampling-based motion planning. This framework determines the validity of a sample robot configuration through a novel combination of a Contractive AutoEncoder (CAE), which captures a occupancy grids representation of the robot's workspace, and a Multilayer Perceptron, which efficiently predicts the collision state of the robot from the CAE and the robot's configuration. We evaluate our framework on multiple planning problems with a variety of robots in 2D and 3D workspaces. The results show that (1) the framework is computationally efficient in all investigated problems, and (2) the framework generalizes well to new workspaces. 

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Tensegrity Robot Locomotion
Abstract:  Tensegrity robots, composed of rigid rods connected by elastic cables, have a number of unique properties that make them appealing for use as planetary exploration rovers. However, control of tensegrity robots remains a difficult problem due to their unusual structures and complex dynamics. In this work, we show how locomotion gaits can be learned automatically using a novel extension of mirror descent guided policy search (MDGPS) applied to periodic locomotion movements, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on tensegrity robot locomotion. We evaluate our method with real-world and simulated experiments on the SUPERball tensegrity robot, showing that the learned policies generalize to changes in system parameters, unreliable sensor measurements, and variation in environmental conditions, including varied terrains and a range of different gravities. Our experiments demonstrate that our method not only learns fast, power-efficient feedback policies for rolling gaits, but that these policies can succeed with only the limited onboard sensing provided by SUPERball's accelerometers. We compare the learned feedback policies to learned open-loop policies and hand-engineered controllers, and demonstrate that the learned policy enables the first continuous, reliable locomotion gait for the real SUPERball robot. Our code and other supplementary materials are available from http://rll.berkeley.edu/drl_tensegrity 

Title: The Right (Angled) Perspective: Improving the Understanding of Road Scenes Using Boosted Inverse Perspective Mapping
Abstract:  Many tasks performed by autonomous vehicles such as road marking detection, object tracking, and path planning are simpler in bird's-eye view. Hence, Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) is often applied to remove the perspective effect from a vehicle's front-facing camera and to remap its images into a 2D domain, resulting in a top-down view. Unfortunately, however, this leads to unnatural blurring and stretching of objects at further distance, due to the resolution of the camera, limiting applicability. In this paper, we present an adversarial learning approach for generating a significantly improved IPM from a single camera image in real time. The generated bird's-eye-view images contain sharper features (e.g. road markings) and a more homogeneous illumination, while (dynamic) objects are automatically removed from the scene, thus revealing the underlying road layout in an improved fashion. We demonstrate our framework using real-world data from the Oxford RobotCar Dataset and show that scene understanding tasks directly benefit from our boosted IPM approach. 

Title: Visual Curiosity: Learning to Ask Questions to Learn Visual Recognition
Abstract:  In an open-world setting, it is inevitable that an intelligent agent (e.g., a robot) will encounter visual objects, attributes or relationships it does not recognize. In this work, we develop an agent empowered with visual curiosity, i.e. the ability to ask questions to an Oracle (e.g., human) about the contents in images (e.g., What is the object on the left side of the red cube?) and build visual recognition model based on the answers received (e.g., Cylinder). In order to do this, the agent must (1) understand what it recognizes and what it does not, (2) formulate a valid, unambiguous and informative language query (a question) to ask the Oracle, (3) derive the parameters of visual classifiers from the Oracle response and (4) leverage the updated visual classifiers to ask more clarified questions. Specifically, we propose a novel framework and formulate the learning of visual curiosity as a reinforcement learning problem. In this framework, all components of our agent, visual recognition module (to see), question generation policy (to ask), answer digestion module (to understand) and graph memory module (to memorize), are learned entirely end-to-end to maximize the reward derived from the scene graph obtained by the agent as a consequence of the dialog with the Oracle. Importantly, the question generation policy is disentangled from the visual recognition system and specifics of the environment. Consequently, we demonstrate a sort of double generalization. Our question generation policy generalizes to new environments and a new pair of eyes, i.e., new visual system. Trained on a synthetic dataset, our results show that our agent learns new visual concepts significantly faster than several heuristic baselines, even when tested on synthetic environments with novel objects, as well as in a realistic environment. 

Title: Gaussian Process Decentralized Data Fusion Meets Transfer Learning in Large-Scale Distributed Cooperative Perception
Abstract:  This paper presents novel Gaussian process decentralized data fusion algorithms exploiting the notion of agent-centric support sets for distributed cooperative perception of large-scale environmental phenomena. To overcome the limitations of scale in existing works, our proposed algorithms allow every mobile sensing agent to choose a different support set and dynamically switch to another during execution for encapsulating its own data into a local summary that, perhaps surprisingly, can still be assimilated with the other agents' local summaries (i.e., based on their current choices of support sets) into a globally consistent summary to be used for predicting the phenomenon. To achieve this, we propose a novel transfer learning mechanism for a team of agents capable of sharing and transferring information encapsulated in a summary based on a support set to that utilizing a different support set with some loss that can be theoretically bounded and analyzed. To alleviate the issue of information loss accumulating over multiple instances of transfer learning, we propose a new information sharing mechanism to be incorporated into our algorithms in order to achieve memory-efficient lazy transfer learning. Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets show that our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods. 

Title: Provably Robust Learning-Based Approach for High-Accuracy Tracking Control of Lagrangian Systems
Abstract:  Lagrangian systems represent a wide range of robotic systems, including manipulators, wheeled and legged robots, and quadrotors. Inverse dynamics control and feedforward linearization techniques are typically used to convert the complex nonlinear dynamics of Lagrangian systems to a set of decoupled double integrators, and then a standard, outer-loop controller can be used to calculate the commanded acceleration for the linearized system. However, these methods typically depend on having a very accurate system model, which is often not available in practice. While this challenge has been addressed in the literature using different learning approaches, most of these approaches do not provide safety guarantees in terms of stability of the learning-based control system. In this paper, we provide a novel, learning-based control approach based on Gaussian processes (GPs) that ensures both stability of the closed-loop system and high-accuracy tracking. We use GPs to approximate the error between the commanded acceleration and the actual acceleration of the system, and then use the predicted mean and variance of the GP to calculate an upper bound on the uncertainty of the linearized model. This uncertainty bound is then used in a robust, outer-loop controller to ensure stability of the overall system. Moreover, we show that the tracking error converges to a ball with a radius that can be made arbitrarily small. Furthermore, we verify the effectiveness of our approach via simulations on a 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF) planar manipulator and experimentally on a 6 DOF industrial manipulator. 

Title: Object-centric Forward Modeling for Model Predictive Control
Abstract:  We present an approach to learn an object-centric forward model, and show that this allows us to plan for sequences of actions to achieve distant desired goals. We propose to model a scene as a collection of objects, each with an explicit spatial location and implicit visual feature, and learn to model the effects of actions using random interaction data. Our model allows capturing the robot-object and object-object interactions, and leads to more sample-efficient and accurate predictions. We show that this learned model can be leveraged to search for action sequences that lead to desired goal configurations, and that in conjunction with a learned correction module, this allows for robust closed loop execution. We present experiments both in simulation and the real world, and show that our approach improves over alternate implicit or pixel-space forward models.

Title: Intrinsic Motivation Driven Intuitive Physics Learning using Deep Reinforcement Learning with Intrinsic Reward Normalization
Abstract:  At an early age, human infants are able to learn and build a model of the world very quickly by constantly observing and interacting with objects around them. One of the most fundamental intuitions human infants acquire is intuitive physics. Human infants learn and develop these models, which later serve as prior knowledge for further learning. Inspired by such behaviors exhibited by human infants, we introduce a graphical physics network integrated with deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we introduce an intrinsic reward normalization method that allows our agent to efficiently choose actions that can improve its intuitive physics model the most. Using a 3D physics engine, we show that our graphical physics network is able to infer object's positions and velocities very effectively, and our deep reinforcement learning network encourages an agent to improve its model by making it continuously interact with objects only using intrinsic motivation. We experiment our model in both stationary and non-stationary state problems and show benefits of our approach in terms of the number of different actions the agent performs and the accuracy of agent's intuition model.

Title: EyeCar: Modeling the Visual Attention Allocation of Drivers in Semi-Autonomous Vehicles
Abstract:  A safe transition between autonomous and manual control requires sustained visual attention of the driver for the perception and assessment of hazards in dynamic driving environments. Thus, drivers must retain a certain level of situation awareness to safely takeover. Understanding the visual attention allocation of drivers can pave the way for inferring their dynamic state of situational awareness. We propose a reinforcement and inverse-reinforcement learning framework for modeling passive drivers' visual attention allocation in semi-autonomous vehicles. The proposed approach measures the eye-movement of passive drivers to evaluate their responses to real-world rear-end collisions. The results show substantial individual differences in the eye fixation patterns by driving experience, even among fully attentive drivers. Experienced drivers were more attentive to the situational dynamics and were able to identify potentially hazardous objects before any collisions occurred. These models of visual attention could potentially be integrated into autonomous systems to continuously monitor and guide effective intervention. Keywords: Visual attention allocation; Situation awareness; Eye movements; Eye fixation; Eye-Tracking; Reinforcement Learning; Inverse Reinforcement Learning 

Title: Discovery and recognition of motion primitives in human activities
Abstract:  We present a novel framework for the automatic discovery and recognition of motion primitives in videos of human activities. Given the 3D pose of a human in a video, human motion primitives are discovered by optimizing the `motion flux', a quantity which captures the motion variation of a group of skeletal joints. A normalization of the primitives is proposed in order to make them invariant with respect to a subject anatomical variations and data sampling rate. The discovered primitives are unknown and unlabeled and are unsupervisedly collected into classes via a hierarchical non-parametric Bayes mixture model. Once classes are determined and labeled they are further analyzed for establishing models for recognizing discovered primitives. Each primitive model is defined by a set of learned parameters. Given new video data and given the estimated pose of the subject appearing on the video, the motion is segmented into primitives, which are recognized with a probability given according to the parameters of the learned models. Using our framework we build a publicly available dataset of human motion primitives, using sequences taken from well-known motion capture datasets. We expect that our framework, by providing an objective way for discovering and categorizing human motion, will be a useful tool in numerous research fields including video analysis, human inspired motion generation, learning by demonstration, intuitive human-robot interaction, and human behavior analysis. 

Title: Anomaly Detection in Unstructured Environments using Bayesian Nonparametric Scene Modeling
Abstract:  This paper explores the use of a Bayesian non-parametric topic modeling technique for the purpose of anomaly detection in video data. We present results from two experiments. The first experiment shows that the proposed technique is automatically able characterize the underlying terrain, and detect anomalous flora in image data collected by an underwater robot. The second experiment shows that the same technique can be used on images from a static camera in a dynamic unstructured environment. In the second dataset, consisting of video data from a static seafloor camera capturing images of a busy coral reef, the proposed technique was able to detect all three instances of an underwater vehicle passing in front of the camera, amongst many other observations of fishes, debris, lighting changes due to surface waves, and benthic flora. 

Title: Hindsight policy gradients
Abstract:  A reinforcement learning agent that needs to pursue different goals across episodes requires a goal-conditional policy. In addition to their potential to generalize desirable behavior to unseen goals, such policies may also enable higher-level planning based on subgoals. In sparse-reward environments, the capacity to exploit information about the degree to which an arbitrary goal has been achieved while another goal was intended appears crucial to enable sample efficient learning. However, reinforcement learning agents have only recently been endowed with such capacity for hindsight. In this paper, we demonstrate how hindsight can be introduced to policy gradient methods, generalizing this idea to a broad class of successful algorithms. Our experiments on a diverse selection of sparse-reward environments show that hindsight leads to a remarkable increase in sample efficiency. 

Title: Deep Learning for Surface Material Classification Using Haptic And Visual Information
Abstract:  When a user scratches a hand-held rigid tool across an object surface, an acceleration signal can be captured, which carries relevant information about the surface. More importantly, such a haptic signal is complementary to the visual appearance of the surface, which suggests the combination of both modalities for the recognition of the surface material. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning method dealing with the surface material classification problem based on a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), which takes as input the aforementioned acceleration signal and a corresponding image of the surface texture. Compared to previous surface material classification solutions, which rely on a careful design of hand-crafted domain-specific features, our method automatically extracts discriminative features utilizing the advanced deep learning methodologies. Experiments performed on the TUM surface material database demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy robustly and efficiently. 

Title: Automatic assembly of aero engine low pressure turbine shaft based on 3D vision measurement
Abstract:  In order to solve the problem of low automation of Aero-engine Turbine shaft assembly and the difficulty of non-contact high-precision measurement, a structured light binocular measurement technology for key components of aero-engine is proposed in this paper. Combined with three-dimensional point cloud data processing and assembly position matching algorithm, the high-precision measurement of shaft hole assembly posture in the process of turbine shaft docking is realized. Firstly, the screw thread curve on the bolt surface is segmented based on PCA projection and edge point cloud clustering, and Hough transform is used to model fit the three-dimensional thread curve. Then the preprocessed two-dimensional convex hull is constructed to segment the key hole location features, and the mounting surface and hole location obtained by segmentation are fitted based on RANSAC method. Finally, the geometric feature matching is used the evaluation index of turbine shaft assembly is established to optimize the pose. The final measurement accuracy of mounting surface matching is less than 0.05mm, and the measurement accuracy of mounting hole matching based on minimum ance optimization is less than 0.1 degree. The measurement algorithm is implemented on the automatic assembly test-bed of a certain type of aero-engine low-pressure turbine rotor. In the narrow installation space, the assembly process of the turbine shaft assembly, such as the automatic alignment and docking of the shaft hole, the automatic heating and temperature measurement of the installation seam, and the automatic tightening of the two guns, are realized in the narrow installation space Guidance, real-time inspection and assembly result evaluation. 

Title: Imitating by generating: deep generative models for imitation of interactive tasks
Abstract:  To coordinate actions with an interaction partner requires a constant exchange of sensorimotor signals. Humans acquire these skills in infancy and early childhood mostly by imitation learning and active engagement with a skilled partner. They require the ability to predict and adapt to one's partner during an interaction. In this work we want to explore these ideas in a human-robot interaction setting in which a robot is required to learn interactive tasks from a combination of observational and kinesthetic learning. To this end, we propose a deep learning framework consisting of a number of components for (1) human and robot motion embedding, (2) motion prediction of the human partner and (3) generation of robot joint trajectories matching the human motion. To test these ideas, we collect human-human interaction data and human-robot interaction data of four interactive tasks "hand-shake", "hand-wave", "parachute fist-bump" and "rocket fist-bump". We demonstrate experimentally the importance of predictive and adaptive components as well as low-level abstractions to successfully learn to imitate human behavior in interactive social tasks. 

Title: Multi-objective Model-based Policy Search for Data-efficient Learning with Sparse Rewards
Abstract:  The most data-efficient algorithms for reinforcement learning in robotics are model-based policy search algorithms, which alternate between learning a dynamical model of the robot and optimizing a policy to maximize the expected return given the model and its uncertainties. However, the current algorithms lack an effective exploration strategy to deal with sparse or misleading reward scenarios: if they do not experience any state with a positive reward during the initial random exploration, it is very unlikely to solve the problem. Here, we propose a novel model-based policy search algorithm, Multi-DEX, that leverages a learned dynamical model to efficiently explore the task space and solve tasks with sparse rewards in a few episodes. To achieve this, we frame the policy search problem as a multi-objective, model-based policy optimization problem with three objectives: (1) generate maximally novel state trajectories, (2) maximize the expected return and (3) keep the system in state-space regions for which the model is as accurate as possible. We then optimize these objectives using a Pareto-based multi-objective optimization algorithm. The experiments show that Multi-DEX is able to solve sparse reward scenarios (with a simulated robotic arm) in much lower interaction time than VIME, TRPO, GEP-PG, CMA-ES and Black-DROPS. 

Title: Exploring Model-based Planning with Policy Networks
Abstract:  Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) with model-predictive control or online planning has shown great potential for locomotion control tasks in terms of both sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. Despite their initial successes, the existing planning methods search from candidate sequences randomly generated in the action space, which is inefficient in complex high-dimensional environments. In this paper, we propose a novel MBRL algorithm, model-based policy planning (POPLIN), that combines policy networks with online planning. More specifically, we formulate action planning at each time-step as an optimization problem using neural networks. We experiment with both optimization w.r.t. the action sequences initialized from the policy network, and also online optimization directly w.r.t. the parameters of the policy network. We show that POPLIN obtains state-of-the-art performance in the MuJoCo benchmarking environments, being about 3x more sample efficient than the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as PETS, TD3 and SAC. To explain the effectiveness of our algorithm, we show that the optimization surface in parameter space is smoother than in action space. Further more, we found the distilled policy network can be effectively applied without the expansive model predictive control during test time for some environments such as Cheetah. Code is released in https://github.com/WilsonWangTHU/POPLIN. 

Title: OrthographicNet: A Deep Learning Approach for 3D Object Recognition in Open-Ended Domains
Abstract:  Service robots are expected to be more autonomous and efficiently work in human-centric environments. For this type of robots, open-ended object recognition is a challenging task due to the high demand for two essential capabilities: (i) the accurate and real-time response, and (ii) the ability to learn new object categories from very few examples on-site. These capabilities are required for such robots since no matter how extensive the training data used for batch learning, the robot might be faced with an unknown object when operating in everyday environments. In this work, we present OrthographicNet, a deep transfer learning based approach, for 3D object recognition in open-ended domains. In particular, OrthographicNet generates a rotation and scale invariant global feature for a given object, enabling to recognize the same or similar objects seen from different perspectives. Experimental results show that our approach yields significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art approaches concerning scalability, memory usage, and object recognition performance. Regarding real-time performance, two real-world demonstrations validate the promising performance of the proposed architecture. Moreover, our approach demonstrates the capability of learning from very few training examples in a real-world setting. 

Title: Redirection Controller Using Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  There is a growing demand for planning redirected walking techniques and applying them to physical environments with obstacles. Such techniques are mainly managed using three kinds of methods: direct scripting, generalized controller, and physical- or virtual-environment analysis to determine user redirection. The first approach is effective when a user's path and both physical and virtual environments are fixed; however, it is difficult to handle irregular movements and reuse other environments. The second approach has the potential of reusing any environment but is less optimized. The last approach is highly anticipated and versatile, although it has not been sufficiently developed. In this study, we propose a novel redirection controller using reinforcement learning with advanced plannability/versatility. Our simulation experiments show that the proposed strategy can reduce the number of resets by 20.3% for physical-space conditions with multiple obstacles. 

Title: Human-like Planning for Reaching in Cluttered Environments
Abstract:  Humans, in comparison to robots, are remarkably adept at reaching for objects in cluttered environments. The best existing robot planners are based on random sampling of configuration space -- which becomes excessively high-dimensional with large number of objects. Consequently, most planners often fail to efficiently find object manipulation plans in such environments. We addressed this problem by identifying high-level manipulation plans in humans, and transferring these skills to robot planners. We used virtual reality to capture human participants reaching for a target object on a tabletop cluttered with obstacles. From this, we devised a qualitative representation of the task space to abstract the decision making, irrespective of the number of obstacles. Based on this representation, human demonstrations were segmented and used to train decision classifiers. Using these classifiers, our planner produced a list of waypoints in task space. These waypoints provided a high-level plan, which could be transferred to an arbitrary robot model and used to initialise a local trajectory optimiser. We evaluated this approach through testing on unseen human VR data, a physics-based robot simulation, and a real robot (dataset and code are publicly available). We found that the human-like planner outperformed a state-of-the-art standard trajectory optimisation algorithm, and was able to generate effective strategies for rapid planning -- irrespective of the number of obstacles in the environment. 

Title: Analysis of Social Robotic Navigation approaches: CNN Encoder and Active Learning as an alternative to Deep Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Dealing with social tasks in robotic scenarios is difficult, as having the human in the learning loop is incompatible with most of the current state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. This is the case when exploring active learning models, in particular the ones involving reinforcement learning. In this work, we discuss this problem and possible solutions by providing a prior study on adaptive convolutional encoders for a social navigation task. 

Title: Ego-motion Sensor for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on a Single-Board Computer
Abstract:  This paper describes the design and implementation of a ground-related odometry sensor suitable for micro aerial vehicles. The sensor is based on a ground-facing camera and a single-board Linux-based embedded computer with a multimedia System on a Chip (SoC). The SoC features a hardware video encoder which is used to estimate the optical flow online. The optical flow is then used in combination with a distance sensor to estimate the vehicle's velocity. The proposed sensor is compared to a similar existing solution and evaluated in both indoor and outdoor environments. 

Title: Online Visual Robot Tracking and Identification using Deep LSTM Networks
Abstract:  Collaborative robots working on a common task are necessary for many applications. One of the challenges for achieving collaboration in a team of robots is mutual tracking and identification. We present a novel pipeline for online visionbased detection, tracking and identification of robots with a known and identical appearance. Our method runs in realtime on the limited hardware of the observer robot. Unlike previous works addressing robot tracking and identification, we use a data-driven approach based on recurrent neural networks to learn relations between sequential inputs and outputs. We formulate the data association problem as multiple classification problems. A deep LSTM network was trained on a simulated dataset and fine-tuned on small set of real data. Experiments on two challenging datasets, one synthetic and one real, which include long-term occlusions, show promising results. 

Title: Adapting control policies from simulation to reality using a pairwise loss
Abstract:  This paper proposes an approach to domain transfer based on a pairwise loss function that helps transfer control policies learned in simulation onto a real robot. We explore the idea in the context of a 'category level' manipulation task where a control policy is learned that enables a robot to perform a mating task involving novel objects. We explore the case where depth images are used as the main form of sensor input. Our experimental results demonstrate that proposed method consistently outperforms baseline methods that train only in simulation or that combine real and simulated data in a naive way. 

Title: Physical Adversarial Textures that Fool Visual Object Tracking
Abstract:  We present a system for generating inconspicuous-looking textures that, when displayed in the physical world as digital or printed posters, cause visual object tracking systems to become confused. For instance, as a target being tracked by a robot's camera moves in front of such a poster, our generated texture makes the tracker lock onto it and allows the target to evade. This work aims to fool seldom-targeted regression tasks, and in particular compares diverse optimization strategies: non-targeted, targeted, and a new family of guided adversarial losses. While we use the Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) algorithm to generate physical adversaries that fool tracking models when imaged under diverse conditions, we compare the impacts of different conditioning variables, including viewpoint, lighting, and appearances, to find practical attack setups with high resulting adversarial strength and convergence speed. We further showcase textures optimized solely using simulated scenes can confuse real-world tracking systems. 

Title: Lane-Merging Using Policy-based Reinforcement Learning and Post-Optimization
Abstract:  Many current behavior generation methods struggle to handle real-world traffic situations as they do not scale well with complexity. However, behaviors can be learned off-line using data-driven approaches. Especially, reinforcement learning is promising as it implicitly learns how to behave utilizing collected experiences. In this work, we combine policy-based reinforcement learning with local optimization to foster and synthesize the best of the two methodologies. The policy-based reinforcement learning algorithm provides an initial solution and guiding reference for the post-optimization. Therefore, the optimizer only has to compute a single homotopy class, e.g.\ drive behind or in front of the other vehicle. By storing the state-history during reinforcement learning, it can be used for constraint checking and the optimizer can account for interactions. The post-optimization additionally acts as a safety-layer and the novel method, thus, can be applied in safety-critical applications. We evaluate the proposed method using lane-change scenarios with a varying number of vehicles. 

Title: On the Performance of ConvNet Features for Place Recognition
Abstract:  After the incredible success of deep learning in the computer vision domain, there has been much interest in applying Convolutional Network (ConvNet) features in robotic fields such as visual navigation and SLAM. Unfortunately, there are fundamental differences and challenges involved. Computer vision datasets are very different in character to robotic camera data, real-time performance is essential, and performance priorities can be different. This paper comprehensively evaluates and compares the utility of three state-of-the-art ConvNets on the problems of particular relevance to navigation for robots; viewpoint-invariance and condition-invariance, and for the first time enables real-time place recognition performance using ConvNets with large maps by integrating a variety of existing (locality-sensitive hashing) and novel (semantic search space partitioning) optimization techniques. We present extensive experiments on four real world datasets cultivated to evaluate each of the specific challenges in place recognition. The results demonstrate that speed-ups of two orders of magnitude can be achieved with minimal accuracy degradation, enabling real-time performance. We confirm that networks trained for semantic place categorization also perform better at (specific) place recognition when faced with severe appearance changes and provide a reference for which networks and layers are optimal for different aspects of the place recognition problem. 

Title: Plan Online, Learn Offline: Efficient Learning and Exploration via Model-Based Control
Abstract:  We propose a plan online and learn offline (POLO) framework for the setting where an agent, with an internal model, needs to continually act and learn in the world. Our work builds on the synergistic relationship between local model-based control, global value function learning, and exploration. We study how local trajectory optimization can cope with approximation errors in the value function, and can stabilize and accelerate value function learning. Conversely, we also study how approximate value functions can help reduce the planning horizon and allow for better policies beyond local solutions. Finally, we also demonstrate how trajectory optimization can be used to perform temporally coordinated exploration in conjunction with estimating uncertainty in value function approximation. This exploration is critical for fast and stable learning of the value function. Combining these components enable solutions to complex simulated control tasks, like humanoid locomotion and dexterous in-hand manipulation, in the equivalent of a few minutes of experience in the real world. 

Title: Learning to Drive in a Day
Abstract:  We demonstrate the first application of deep reinforcement learning to autonomous driving. From randomly initialised parameters, our model is able to learn a policy for lane following in a handful of training episodes using a single monocular image as input. We provide a general and easy to obtain reward: the distance travelled by the vehicle without the safety driver taking control. We use a continuous, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm, with all exploration and optimisation performed on-vehicle. This demonstrates a new framework for autonomous driving which moves away from reliance on defined logical rules, mapping, and direct supervision. We discuss the challenges and opportunities to scale this approach to a broader range of autonomous driving tasks. 

Title: From Video Game to Real Robot: The Transfer between Action Spaces
Abstract:  Deep reinforcement learning has proven to be successful for learning tasks in simulated environments, but applying same techniques for robots in real-world domain is more challenging, as they require hours of training. To address this, transfer learning can be used to train the policy first in a simulated environment and then transfer it to physical agent. As the simulation never matches reality perfectly, the physics, visuals and action spaces by necessity differ between these environments to some degree. In this work, we study how general video games can be directly used instead of fine-tuned simulations for the sim-to-real transfer. Especially, we study how the agent can learn the new action space autonomously, when the game actions do not match the robot actions. Our results show that the different action space can be learned by re-training only part of neural network and we obtain above 90% mean success rate in simulation and robot experiments. 

Title: NoRML: No-Reward Meta Learning
Abstract:  Efficiently adapting to new environments and changes in dynamics is critical for agents to successfully operate in the real world. Reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches typically rely on external reward feedback for adaptation. However, in many scenarios this reward signal might not be readily available for the target task, or the difference between the environments can be implicit and only observable from the dynamics. To this end, we introduce a method that allows for self-adaptation of learned policies: No-Reward Meta Learning (NoRML). NoRML extends Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) for RL and uses observable dynamics of the environment instead of an explicit reward function in MAML's finetune step. Our method has a more expressive update step than MAML, while maintaining MAML's gradient based foundation. Additionally, in order to allow more targeted exploration, we implement an extension to MAML that effectively disconnects the meta-policy parameters from the fine-tuned policies' parameters. We first study our method on a number of synthetic control problems and then validate our method on common benchmark environments, showing that NoRML outperforms MAML when the dynamics change between tasks. 

Title: Kiwifruit detection in challenging conditions
Abstract:  Accurate and reliable kiwifruit detection is one of the biggest challenges in developing a selective fruit harvesting robot. The vision system of an orchard robot faces difficulties such as dynamic lighting conditions and fruit occlusions. This paper presents a semantic segmentation approach with two novel image prepossessing techniques designed to detect kiwifruit under the harsh lighting conditions found in the canopy. The performance of the presented system is evaluated on a 3D real-world image set of kiwifruit under different lighting conditions (typical, glare, and overexposed). Alone the semantic segmentation approach achieves an F1_score of 0.82 on the typical lighting image set, but struggles with harsh lighting with an F1_score of 0.13. Utilising the prepossessing techniques the vision system under harsh lighting improves to an F1_score 0.42. To address the fruit occlusion challenge, the overall approach was found to be capable of detecting 87.0% of non-occluded and 30.0% of occluded kiwifruit across all lighting conditions. 

Title: Stochastic Neural Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Deep reinforcement learning has achieved many impressive results in recent years. However, tasks with sparse rewards or long horizons continue to pose significant challenges. To tackle these important problems, we propose a general framework that first learns useful skills in a pre-training environment, and then leverages the acquired skills for learning faster in downstream tasks. Our approach brings together some of the strengths of intrinsic motivation and hierarchical methods: the learning of useful skill is guided by a single proxy reward, the design of which requires very minimal domain knowledge about the downstream tasks. Then a high-level policy is trained on top of these skills, providing a significant improvement of the exploration and allowing to tackle sparse rewards in the downstream tasks. To efficiently pre-train a large span of skills, we use Stochastic Neural Networks combined with an information-theoretic regularizer. Our experiments show that this combination is effective in learning a wide span of interpretable skills in a sample-efficient way, and can significantly boost the learning performance uniformly across a wide range of downstream tasks. 

Title: Contextual Policy Transfer in Reinforcement Learning Domains via Deep Mixtures-of-Experts
Abstract:  In reinforcement learning, agents that consider the context, or current state, when selecting source policies for transfer have been shown to outperform context-free approaches. However, none of the existing approaches transfer knowledge contextually from model-based learners to a model-free learner. This could be useful, for instance, when source policies are intentionally learned on diverse simulations with plentiful data but transferred to a real-world setting with limited data. In this paper, we assume knowledge of estimated source task dynamics and policies, and common sub-goals but different dynamics. We introduce a novel deep mixture-of-experts formulation for learning state-dependent beliefs over source task dynamics that match the target dynamics using state trajectories collected from the target task. The mixture model is easy to interpret, demonstrates robustness to estimation errors in dynamics, and is compatible with most learning algorithms. We then show how this model can be incorporated into standard policy reuse frameworks, and demonstrate its effectiveness on benchmarks from OpenAI-Gym. 

Title: Dense Object Reconstruction from RGBD Images with Embedded Deep Shape Representations
Abstract:  Most problems involving simultaneous localization and mapping can nowadays be solved using one of two fundamentally different approaches. The traditional approach is given by a least-squares objective, which minimizes many local photometric or geometric residuals over explicitly parametrized structure and camera parameters. Unmodeled effects violating the lambertian surface assumption or geometric invariances of individual residuals are encountered through statistical averaging or the addition of robust kernels and smoothness terms. Aiming at more accurate measurement models and the inclusion of higher-order shape priors, the community more recently shifted its attention to deep end-to-end models for solving geometric localization and mapping problems. However, at test-time, these feed-forward models ignore the more traditional geometric or photometric consistency terms, thus leading to a low ability to recover fine details and potentially complete failure in corner case scenarios. With an application to dense object modeling from RGBD images, our work aims at taking the best of both worlds by embedding modern higher-order object shape priors into classical iterative residual minimization objectives. We demonstrate a general ability to improve mapping accuracy with respect to each modality alone, and present a successful application to real data. 

Title: FreiHAND: A Dataset for Markerless Capture of Hand Pose and Shape from Single RGB Images
Abstract:  Estimating 3D hand pose from single RGB images is a highly ambiguous problem that relies on an unbiased training dataset. In this paper, we analyze cross-dataset generalization when training on existing datasets. We find that approaches perform well on the datasets they are trained on, but do not generalize to other datasets or in-the-wild scenarios. As a consequence, we introduce the first large-scale, multi-view hand dataset that is accompanied by both 3D hand pose and shape annotations. For annotating this real-world dataset, we propose an iterative, semi-automated `human-in-the-loop' approach, which includes hand fitting optimization to infer both the 3D pose and shape for each sample. We show that methods trained on our dataset consistently perform well when tested on other datasets. Moreover, the dataset allows us to train a network that predicts the full articulated hand shape from a single RGB image. The evaluation set can serve as a benchmark for articulated hand shape estimation. 

Title: Deep Learning for Vision-based Prediction: A Survey

The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the field in the past five years with a particular focus on deep learning approaches. For this purpose, we categorize these algorithms into video prediction, action prediction, trajectory prediction, body motion prediction, and other prediction applications. For each category, we highlight the common architectures, training methods and types of data used. In addition, we discuss the common evaluation metrics and datasets used for vision-based prediction tasks. A database of all the information presented in this survey including, cross-referenced according to papers, datasets and metrics, can be found online at https://github.com/aras62/vision-based-prediction. 

Title: Graph Neural Networks for 3D Multi-Object Tracking
Abstract:  3D Multi-object tracking (MOT) is crucial to autonomous systems. Recent work often uses a tracking-by-detection pipeline, where the feature of each object is extracted independently to compute an affinity matrix. Then, the affinity matrix is passed to the Hungarian algorithm for data association. A key process of this pipeline is to learn discriminative features for different objects in order to reduce confusion during data association. To that end, we propose two innovative techniques: (1) instead of obtaining the features for each object independently, we propose a novel feature interaction mechanism by introducing Graph Neural Networks; (2) instead of obtaining the features from either 2D or 3D space as in prior work, we propose a novel joint feature extractor to learn appearance and motion features from 2D and 3D space. Through experiments on the KITTI dataset, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art 3D MOT performance. Our project website is at http://www.xinshuoweng.com/projects/GNN3DMOT. 

Title: Regularizing Model-Based Planning with Energy-Based Models
Abstract:  Model-based reinforcement learning could enable sample-efficient learning by quickly acquiring rich knowledge about the world and using it to improve behaviour without additional data. Learned dynamics models can be directly used for planning actions but this has been challenging because of inaccuracies in the learned models. In this paper, we focus on planning with learned dynamics models and propose to regularize it using energy estimates of state transitions in the environment. We visually demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that off-policy training of an energy estimator can be effectively used to regularize planning with pre-trained dynamics models. Further, we demonstrate that the proposed method enables sample-efficient learning to achieve competitive performance in challenging continuous control tasks such as Half-cheetah and Ant in just a few minutes of experience. 

Title: From Planes to Corners: Multi-Purpose Primitive Detection in Unorganized 3D Point Clouds
Abstract:  We propose a new method for segmentation-free joint estimation of orthogonal planes, their intersection lines, relationship graph and corners lying at the intersection of three orthogonal planes. Such unified scene exploration under orthogonality allows for multitudes of applications such as semantic plane detection or local and global scan alignment, which in turn can aid robot localization or grasping tasks. Our two-stage pipeline involves a rough yet joint estimation of orthogonal planes followed by a subsequent joint refinement of plane parameters respecting their orthogonality relations. We form a graph of these primitives, paving the way to the extraction of further reliable features: lines and corners. Our experiments demonstrate the validity of our approach in numerous scenarios from wall detection to 6D tracking, both on synthetic and real data. 

Title: DiGrad: Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning with Shared Actions
Abstract:  Most reinforcement learning algorithms are inefficient for learning multiple tasks in complex robotic systems, where different tasks share a set of actions. In such environments a compound policy may be learnt with shared neural network parameters, which performs multiple tasks concurrently. However such compound policy may get biased towards a task or the gradients from different tasks negate each other, making the learning unstable and sometimes less data efficient. In this paper, we propose a new approach for simultaneous training of multiple tasks sharing a set of common actions in continuous action spaces, which we call as DiGrad (Differential Policy Gradient). The proposed framework is based on differential policy gradients and can accommodate multi-task learning in a single actor-critic network. We also propose a simple heuristic in the differential policy gradient update to further improve the learning. The proposed architecture was tested on 8 link planar manipulator and 27 degrees of freedom(DoF) Humanoid for learning multi-goal reachability tasks for 3 and 2 end effectors respectively. We show that our approach supports efficient multi-task learning in complex robotic systems, outperforming related methods in continuous action spaces. 

Title: A Variational Observation Model of 3D Object for Probabilistic Semantic SLAM
Abstract:  We present a Bayesian object observation model for complete probabilistic semantic SLAM. Recent studies on object detection and feature extraction have become important for scene understanding and 3D mapping. However, 3D shape of the object is too complex to formulate the probabilistic observation model; therefore, performing the Bayesian inference of the object-oriented features as well as their pose is less considered. Besides, when the robot equipped with an RGB mono camera only observes the projected single view of an object, a significant amount of the 3D shape information is abandoned. Due to these limitations, semantic SLAM and viewpoint-independent loop closure using volumetric 3D object shape is challenging. In order to enable the complete formulation of probabilistic semantic SLAM, we approximate the observation model of a 3D object with a tractable distribution. We also estimate the variational likelihood from the 2D image of the object to exploit its observed single view. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we perform pose and feature estimation, and demonstrate that the automatic loop closure works seamlessly without additional loop detector in various environments. 

Title: Action Image Representation: Learning Scalable Deep Grasping Policies with Zero Real World Data
Abstract:  This paper introduces Action Image, a new grasp proposal representation that allows learning an end-to-end deep-grasping policy. Our model achieves $84\%$ grasp success on $172$ real world objects while being trained only in simulation on $48$ objects with just naive domain randomization. Similar to computer vision problems, such as object detection, Action Image builds on the idea that object features are invariant to translation in image space. Therefore, grasp quality is invariant when evaluating the object-gripper relationship; a successful grasp for an object depends on its local context, but is independent of the surrounding environment. Action Image represents a grasp proposal as an image and uses a deep convolutional network to infer grasp quality. We show that by using an Action Image representation, trained networks are able to extract local, salient features of grasping tasks that generalize across different objects and environments. We show that this representation works on a variety of inputs, including color images (RGB), depth images (D), and combined color-depth (RGB-D). Our experimental results demonstrate that networks utilizing an Action Image representation exhibit strong domain transfer between training on simulated data and inference on real-world sensor streams. Finally, our experiments show that a network trained with Action Image improves grasp success ($84\%$ vs. $53\%$) over a baseline model with the same structure, but using actions encoded as vectors. 

Title: A 3D-Deep-Learning-based Augmented Reality Calibration Method for Robotic Environments using Depth Sensor Data
Abstract:  Augmented Reality and mobile robots are gaining much attention within industries due to the high potential to make processes cost and time efficient. To facilitate augmented reality, a calibration between the Augmented Reality device and the environment is necessary. This is a challenge when dealing with mobile robots due to the mobility of all entities making the environment dynamic. On this account, we propose a novel approach to calibrate the Augmented Reality device using 3D depth sensor data. We use the depth camera of a cutting edge Augmented Reality Device - the Microsoft Hololens for deep learning based calibration. Therefore, we modified a neural network based on the recently published VoteNet architecture which works directly on the point cloud input observed by the Hololens. We achieve satisfying results and eliminate external tools like markers, thus enabling a more intuitive and flexible work flow for Augmented Reality integration. The results are adaptable to work with all depth cameras and are promising for further research. Furthermore, we introduce an open source 3D point cloud labeling tool, which is to our knowledge the first open source tool for labeling raw point cloud data. 

Title: Gradient Surgery for Multi-Task Learning
Abstract:  While deep learning and deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems have demonstrated impressive results in domains such as image classification, game playing, and robotic control, data efficiency remains a major challenge. Multi-task learning has emerged as a promising approach for sharing structure across multiple tasks to enable more efficient learning. However, the multi-task setting presents a number of optimization challenges, making it difficult to realize large efficiency gains compared to learning tasks independently. The reasons why multi-task learning is so challenging compared to single-task learning are not fully understood. In this work, we identify a set of three conditions of the multi-task optimization landscape that cause detrimental gradient interference, and develop a simple yet general approach for avoiding such interference between task gradients. We propose a form of gradient surgery that projects a task's gradient onto the normal plane of the gradient of any other task that has a conflicting gradient. On a series of challenging multi-task supervised and multi-task RL problems, this approach leads to substantial gains in efficiency and performance. Further, it is model-agnostic and can be combined with previously-proposed multi-task architectures for enhanced performance. 

Title: A Robust Framework for Moving-Object Detection and Vehicular Traffic Density Estimation
Abstract:  Intelligent machines require basic information such as moving-object detection from videos in order to deduce higher-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose a methodology that uses a texture measure to detect moving objects in video. The methodology is computationally inexpensive, requires minimal parameter fine-tuning and also is resilient to noise, illumination changes, dynamic background and low frame rate. Experimental results show that performance of the proposed approach is higher than those of state-of-the-art approaches. We also present a framework for vehicular traffic density estimation using the foreground object detection technique and present a comparison between the foreground object detection-based framework and the classical density state modelling-based framework for vehicular traffic density estimation. 

Title: Flappy Hummingbird: An Open Source Dynamic Simulation of Flapping Wing Robots and Animals
Abstract:  Insects and hummingbirds exhibit extraordinary flight capabilities and can simultaneously master seemingly conflicting goals: stable hovering and aggressive maneuvering, unmatched by small scale man-made vehicles. Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicles (FWMAVs) hold great promise for closing this performance gap. However, design and control of such systems remain challenging due to various constraints. Here, we present an open source high fidelity dynamic simulation for FWMAVs to serve as a testbed for the design, optimization and flight control of FWMAVs. For simulation validation, we recreated the hummingbird-scale robot developed in our lab in the simulation. System identification was performed to obtain the model parameters. The force generation, open-loop and closed-loop dynamic response between simulated and experimental flights were compared and validated. The unsteady aerodynamics and the highly nonlinear flight dynamics present challenging control problems for conventional and learning control algorithms such as Reinforcement Learning. The interface of the simulation is fully compatible with OpenAI Gym environment. As a benchmark study, we present a linear controller for hovering stabilization and a Deep Reinforcement Learning control policy for goal-directed maneuvering. Finally, we demonstrate direct simulation-to-real transfer of both control policies onto the physical robot, further demonstrating the fidelity of the simulation. 

Title: A Hierarchical Architecture for Sequential Decision-Making in Autonomous Driving using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Tactical decision making is a critical feature for advanced driving systems, that incorporates several challenges such as complexity of the uncertain environment and reliability of the autonomous system. In this work, we develop a multi-modal architecture that includes the environmental modeling of ego surrounding and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent that yields consistent performance in stochastic highway driving scenarios. To this end, we feed the occupancy grid of the ego surrounding into the DRL agent and obtain the high-level sequential commands (i.e. lane change) to send them to lower-level controllers. We will show that dividing the autonomous driving problem into a multi-layer control architecture enables us to leverage the AI power to solve each layer separately and achieve an admissible reliability score. Comparing with end-to-end approaches, this architecture enables us to end up with a more reliable system which can be implemented in actual self-driving cars. 

Title: Real-time Kinematic Ground Truth for the Oxford RobotCar Dataset
Abstract:  We describe the release of reference data towards a challenging long-term localisation and mapping benchmark based on the large-scale Oxford RobotCar Dataset. The release includes 72 traversals of a route through Oxford, UK, gathered in all illumination, weather and traffic conditions, and is representative of the conditions an autonomous vehicle would be expected to operate reliably in. Using post-processed raw GPS, IMU, and static GNSS base station recordings, we have produced a globally-consistent centimetre-accurate ground truth for the entire year-long duration of the dataset. Coupled with a planned online benchmarking service, we hope to enable quantitative evaluation and comparison of different localisation and mapping approaches focusing on long-term autonomy for road vehicles in urban environments challenged by changing weather. 

Title: Self-supervised learning for autonomous vehicles perception: A conciliation between analytical and learning methods
Abstract:  Nowadays, supervised deep learning techniques yield the best state-of-the-art prediction performances for a wide variety of computer vision tasks. However, such supervised techniques generally require a large amount of manually labeled training data. In the context of autonomous vehicles perception, this requirement is critical, as the distribution of sensor data can continuously change and include several unexpected variations. It turns out that a category of learning techniques, referred to as self-supervised learning (SSL), consists of replacing the manual labeling effort by an automatic labeling process. Thanks to their ability to learn on the application time and in varying environments, state-of-the-art SSL techniques provide a valid alternative to supervised learning for a variety of different tasks, including long-range traversable area segmentation, moving obstacle instance segmentation, long-term moving obstacle tracking, or depth map prediction. In this tutorial-style article, we present an overview and a general formalization of the concept of self-supervised learning (SSL) for autonomous vehicles perception. This formalization provides helpful guidelines for developing novel frameworks based on generic SSL principles. Moreover, it enables to point out significant challenges in the design of future SSL systems. 

Title: Hybrid system identification using switching density networks
Abstract:  Behaviour cloning is a commonly used strategy for imitation learning and can be extremely effective in constrained domains. However, in cases where the dynamics of an environment may be state dependent and varying, behaviour cloning places a burden on model capacity and the number of demonstrations required. This paper introduces switching density networks, which rely on a categorical reparametrisation for hybrid system identification. This results in a network comprising a classification layer that is followed by a regression layer. We use switching density networks to predict the parameters of hybrid control laws, which are toggled by a switching layer to produce different controller outputs, when conditioned on an input state. This work shows how switching density networks can be used for hybrid system identification in a variety of tasks, successfully identifying the key joint angle goals that make up manipulation tasks, while simultaneously learning image-based goal classifiers and regression networks that predict joint angles from images. We also show that they can cluster the phase space of an inverted pendulum, identifying the balance, spin and pump controllers required to solve this task. Switching density networks can be difficult to train, but we introduce a cross entropy regularisation loss that stabilises training. 

Title: Learning Deep Control Policies for Autonomous Aerial Vehicles with MPC-Guided Policy Search
Abstract:  Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective method for controlling robotic systems, particularly autonomous aerial vehicles such as quadcopters. However, application of MPC can be computationally demanding, and typically requires estimating the state of the system, which can be challenging in complex, unstructured environments. Reinforcement learning can in principle forego the need for explicit state estimation and acquire a policy that directly maps sensor readings to actions, but is difficult to apply to unstable systems that are liable to fail catastrophically during training before an effective policy has been found. We propose to combine MPC with reinforcement learning in the framework of guided policy search, where MPC is used to generate data at training time, under full state observations provided by an instrumented training environment. This data is used to train a deep neural network policy, which is allowed to access only the raw observations from the vehicle's onboard sensors. After training, the neural network policy can successfully control the robot without knowledge of the full state, and at a fraction of the computational cost of MPC. We evaluate our method by learning obstacle avoidance policies for a simulated quadrotor, using simulated onboard sensors and no explicit state estimation at test time. 

Title: Driving in the Matrix: Can Virtual Worlds Replace Human-Generated Annotations for Real World Tasks?
Abstract:  Deep learning has rapidly transformed the state of the art algorithms used to address a variety of problems in computer vision and robotics. These breakthroughs have relied upon massive amounts of human annotated training data. This time consuming process has begun impeding the progress of these deep learning efforts. This paper describes a method to incorporate photo-realistic computer images from a simulation engine to rapidly generate annotated data that can be used for the training of machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate that a state of the art architecture, which is trained only using these synthetic annotations, performs better than the identical architecture trained on human annotated real-world data, when tested on the KITTI data set for vehicle detection. By training machine learning algorithms on a rich virtual world, real objects in real scenes can be learned and classified using synthetic data. This approach offers the possibility of accelerating deep learning's application to sensor-based classification problems like those that appear in self-driving cars. The source code and data to train and validate the networks described in this paper are made available for researchers. 

Title: Learning State-Dependent Losses for Inverse Dynamics Learning
Abstract:  Being able to quickly adapt to changes in dynamics is paramount in model-based control for object manipulation tasks. In order to influence fast adaptation of the inverse dynamics model's parameters, data efficiency is crucial. Given observed data, a key element to how an optimizer updates model parameters is the loss function. In this work, we propose to apply meta-learning to learn structured, state-dependent loss functions during a meta-training phase. We then replace standard losses with our learned losses during online adaptation tasks. We evaluate our proposed approach on inverse dynamics learning tasks, both in simulation and on real hardware data. In both settings, the structured and state-dependent learned losses improve online adaptation speed, when compared to standard, state-independent loss functions. 

Title: FastDepth: Fast Monocular Depth Estimation on Embedded Systems
Abstract:  Depth sensing is a critical function for robotic tasks such as localization, mapping and obstacle detection. There has been a significant and growing interest in depth estimation from a single RGB image, due to the relatively low cost and size of monocular cameras. However, state-of-the-art single-view depth estimation algorithms are based on fairly complex deep neural networks that are too slow for real-time inference on an embedded platform, for instance, mounted on a micro aerial vehicle. In this paper, we address the problem of fast depth estimation on embedded systems. We propose an efficient and lightweight encoder-decoder network architecture and apply network pruning to further reduce computational complexity and latency. In particular, we focus on the design of a low-latency decoder. Our methodology demonstrates that it is possible to achieve similar accuracy as prior work on depth estimation, but at inference speeds that are an order of magnitude faster. Our proposed network, FastDepth, runs at 178 fps on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 GPU and at 27 fps when using only the TX2 CPU, with active power consumption under 10 W. FastDepth achieves close to state-of-the-art accuracy on the NYU Depth v2 dataset. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper demonstrates real-time monocular depth estimation using a deep neural network with the lowest latency and highest throughput on an embedded platform that can be carried by a micro aerial vehicle. 

Title: A Low Cost Vision Based Hybrid Fiducial Mark Tracking Technique for Mobile Industrial Robots
Abstract:  The field of robotic vision is developing rapidly. Robots can react intelligently and provide assistance to user activities through sentient computing. Since industrial applications pose complex requirements that cannot be handled by humans, an efficient low cost and robust technique is required for the tracking of mobile industrial robots. The existing sensor based techniques for mobile robot tracking are expensive and complex to deploy, configure and maintain. Also some of them demand dedicated and often expensive hardware. This paper presents a low cost vision based technique called Hybrid Fiducial Mark Tracking (HFMT) technique for tracking mobile industrial robot. HFMT technique requires off-the-shelf hardware (CCD cameras) and printable 2-D circular marks used as fiducials for tracking a mobile industrial robot on a pre-defined path. This proposed technique allows the robot to track on a predefined path by using fiducials for the detection of Right and Left turns on the path and White Strip for tracking the path. The HFMT technique is implemented and tested on an indoor mobile robot at our laboratory. Experimental results from robot navigating in real environments have confirmed that our approach is simple and robust and can be adopted in any hostile industrial environment where humans are unable to work. 

Title: A Survey on Deep Learning for Localization and Mapping: Towards the Age of Spatial Machine Intelligence
Abstract:  Deep learning based localization and mapping has recently attracted significant attention. Instead of creating hand-designed algorithms through exploitation of physical models or geometric theories, deep learning based solutions provide an alternative to solve the problem in a data-driven way. Benefiting from ever-increasing volumes of data and computational power, these methods are fast evolving into a new area that offers accurate and robust systems to track motion and estimate scenes and their structure for real-world applications. In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey, and propose a new taxonomy for localization and mapping using deep learning. We also discuss the limitations of current models, and indicate possible future directions. A wide range of topics are covered, from learning odometry estimation, mapping, to global localization and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We revisit the problem of perceiving self-motion and scene understanding with on-board sensors, and show how to solve it by integrating these modules into a prospective spatial machine intelligence system (SMIS). It is our hope that this work can connect emerging works from robotics, computer vision and machine learning communities, and serve as a guide for future researchers to apply deep learning to tackle localization and mapping problems. 

Title: Robust Point Cloud Based Reconstruction of Large-Scale Outdoor Scenes
Abstract:  Outlier feature matches and loop-closures that survived front-end data association can lead to catastrophic failures in the back-end optimization of large-scale point cloud based 3D reconstruction. To alleviate this problem, we propose a probabilistic approach for robust back-end optimization in the presence of outliers. More specifically, we model the problem as a Bayesian network and solve it using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Our approach leverages on a long-tail Cauchy distribution to suppress outlier feature matches in the odometry constraints, and a Cauchy-Uniform mixture model with a set of binary latent variables to simultaneously suppress outlier loop-closure constraints and outlier feature matches in the inlier loop-closure constraints. Furthermore, we show that by using a Gaussian-Uniform mixture model, our approach degenerates to the formulation of a state-of-the-art approach for robust indoor reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach has comparable performance with the state-of-the-art on a benchmark indoor dataset, and outperforms it on a large-scale outdoor dataset. Our source code can be found on the project website. 

Title: Towards Precise Robotic Grasping by Probabilistic Post-grasp Displacement Estimation
Abstract:  Precise robotic grasping is important for many industrial applications, such as assembly and palletizing, where the location of the object needs to be controlled and known. However, achieving precise grasps is challenging due to noise in sensing and control, as well as unknown object properties. We propose a method to plan robotic grasps that are both robust and precise by training two convolutional neural networks - one to predict the robustness of a grasp and another to predict a distribution of post-grasp object displacements. Our networks are trained with depth images in simulation on a dataset of over 1000 industrial parts and were successfully deployed on a real robot without having to be further fine-tuned. The proposed displacement estimator achieves a mean prediction errors of 0.68cm and 3.42deg on novel objects in real world experiments. 

Title: Object Recognition from very few Training Examples for Enhancing Bicycle Maps
Abstract:  In recent years, data-driven methods have shown great success for extracting information about the infrastructure in urban areas. These algorithms are usually trained on large datasets consisting of thousands or millions of labeled training examples. While large datasets have been published regarding cars, for cyclists very few labeled data is available although appearance, point of view, and positioning of even relevant objects differ. Unfortunately, labeling data is costly and requires a huge amount of work. In this paper, we thus address the problem of learning with very few labels. The aim is to recognize particular traffic signs in crowdsourced data to collect information which is of interest to cyclists. We propose a system for object recognition that is trained with only 15 examples per class on average. To achieve this, we combine the advantages of convolutional neural networks and random forests to learn a patch-wise classifier. In the next step, we map the random forest to a neural network and transform the classifier to a fully convolutional network. Thereby, the processing of full images is significantly accelerated and bounding boxes can be predicted. Finally, we integrate data of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to localize the predictions on the map. In comparison to Faster R-CNN and other networks for object recognition or algorithms for transfer learning, we considerably reduce the required amount of labeled data. We demonstrate good performance on the recognition of traffic signs for cyclists as well as their localization in maps. 

Title: Visual Memorability for Robotic Interestingness via Unsupervised Online Learning
Abstract:  In this paper, we explore the problem of interesting scene prediction for mobile robots. This area is currently underexplored but is crucial for many practical applications such as autonomous exploration and decision making. Inspired by industrial demands, we first propose a novel translation-invariant visual memory for recalling and identifying interesting scenes, then design a three-stage architecture of long-term, short-term, and online learning. This enables our system to learn human-like experience, environmental knowledge, and online adaption, respectively. Our approach achieves much higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art algorithms on challenging robotic interestingness datasets. 

Title: A Deep Incremental Boltzmann Machine for Modeling Context in Robots
Abstract:  Context is an essential capability for robots that are to be as adaptive as possible in challenging environments. Although there are many context modeling efforts, they assume a fixed structure and number of contexts. In this paper, we propose an incremental deep model that extends Restricted Boltzmann Machines. Our model gets one scene at a time, and gradually extends the contextual model when necessary, either by adding a new context or a new context layer to form a hierarchy. We show on a scene classification benchmark that our method converges to a good estimate of the contexts of the scenes, and performs better or on-par on several tasks compared to other incremental models or non-incremental models. 

Title: Study of dynamical system based obstacle avoidance via manipulating orthogonal coordinates
Abstract:  In this paper, we consider the general problem of obstacle avoidance based on dynamical system. The modulation matrix is developed by introducing orthogonal coordinates, which makes the modulation matrix more reasonable. The new trajectory's direction can be represented by the linear combination of orthogonal coordinates. A orthogonal coordinates manipulating approach is proposed by introducing rotating matrix to solve the local minimal problem and provide more reasonable motions in 3-D or higher dimension space. The proposed method also provide a solution for patrolling around a convex shape. Experimental results on several designed dynamical systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 

Title: Bootstrapping Intrinsically Motivated Learning with Human Demonstrations
Abstract:  This paper studies the coupling of internally guided learning and social interaction, and more specifically the improvement owing to demonstrations of the learning by intrinsic motivation. We present Socially Guided Intrinsic Motivation by Demonstration (SGIM-D), an algorithm for learning in continuous, unbounded and non-preset environments. After introducing social learning and intrinsic motivation, we describe the design of our algorithm, before showing through a fishing experiment that SGIM-D efficiently combines the advantages of social learning and intrinsic motivation to gain a wide repertoire while being specialised in specific subspaces. 

Title: Continuous Relaxation of Symbolic Planner for One-Shot Imitation Learning
Abstract:  We address one-shot imitation learning, where the goal is to execute a previously unseen task based on a single demonstration. While there has been exciting progress in this direction, most of the approaches still require a few hundred tasks for meta-training, which limits the scalability of the approaches. Our main contribution is to formulate one-shot imitation learning as a symbolic planning problem along with the symbol grounding problem. This formulation disentangles the policy execution from the inter-task generalization and leads to better data efficiency. The key technical challenge is that the symbol grounding is prone to error with limited training data and leads to subsequent symbolic planning failures. We address this challenge by proposing a continuous relaxation of the discrete symbolic planner that directly plans on the probabilistic outputs of the symbol grounding model. Our continuous relaxation of the planner can still leverage the information contained in the probabilistic symbol grounding and significantly improve over the baseline planner for the one-shot imitation learning tasks without using large training data. 

Title: Learning Compositional Koopman Operators for Model-Based Control
Abstract:  Finding an embedding space for a linear approximation of a nonlinear dynamical system enables efficient system identification and control synthesis. The Koopman operator theory lays the foundation for identifying the nonlinear-to-linear coordinate transformations with data-driven methods. Recently, researchers have proposed to use deep neural networks as a more expressive class of basis functions for calculating the Koopman operators. These approaches, however, assume a fixed dimensional state space; they are therefore not applicable to scenarios with a variable number of objects. In this paper, we propose to learn compositional Koopman operators, using graph neural networks to encode the state into object-centric embeddings and using a block-wise linear transition matrix to regularize the shared structure across objects. The learned dynamics can quickly adapt to new environments of unknown physical parameters and produce control signals to achieve a specified goal. Our experiments on manipulating ropes and controlling soft robots show that the proposed method has better efficiency and generalization ability than existing baselines. 

Title: 3D Lidar Mapping Relative Accuracy Automatic Evaluation Algorithm
Abstract:  HD (High Definition) map based on 3D lidar plays a vital role in autonomous vehicle localization, planning, decision-making, perception, etc. Many 3D lidar mapping technologies related to SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) are used in HD map construction to ensure its high accuracy. To evaluate the accuracy of 3D lidar mapping, the most common methods use ground truth of poses to calculate the error between estimated poses and ground truth, however it's usually so difficult to get the ground truth of poses in the actual lidar mapping for autonomous vehicle. In this paper, we proposed a relative accuracy evaluation algorithm that can automatically evaluate the accuracy of HD map built by 3D lidar mapping without ground truth. A method for detecting the degree of ghosting in point cloud map quantitatively is designed to reflect the accuracy indirectly, which takes advantage of the principle of light traveling in a straight line and the fact that light can not penetrate opaque objects. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed evaluation algorithm can automatically and efficiently detect the bad poses whose accuracy are less than the set threshold such as 0.1m, then calculate the bad poses percentage P_bad in all estimated poses to obtain the final accuracy metric P_acc = 1 - P_bad. 

Title: Stereo-based Multi-motion Visual Odometry for Mobile Robots
Abstract:  With the development of computer vision, visual odometry is adopted by more and more mobile robots. However, we found that not only its own pose, but the poses of other moving objects are also crucial for the decision of the robot. In addition, the visual odometry will be greatly disturbed when a significant moving object appears. In this letter, a stereo-based multi-motion visual odometry method is proposed to acquire the poses of the robot and other moving objects. In order to obtain the poses simultaneously, a continuous motion segmentation module and a coordinate conversion module are applied to the traditional visual odometry pipeline. As a result, poses of all moving objects can be acquired and transformed into the ground coordinate system. The experimental results show that the proposed multi-motion visual odometry can effectively eliminate the influence of moving objects on the visual odometry, as well as achieve 10 cm in position and 3{\deg} in orientation RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of each moving object. 

Title: Data-efficient visuomotor policy training using reinforcement learning and generative models
Abstract:  We present a data-efficient framework for solving deep visuomotor sequential decision-making problems which exploits the combination of reinforcement learning (RL) with the latent variable generative models. Our framework trains deep visuomotor policies by introducing an action latent variable such that the feed-forward policy search can be divided into two parts: (1) training a sub-policy that outputs a distribution over the action latent variable given a state of the system, and (2) training a generative model that outputs a sequence of motor actions given a latent action representation. Our approach enables safe exploration and alleviates the data-inefficiency problem as it exploits prior knowledge about valid sequences of motor actions. Moreover, by evaluating the quality of the generative models we are able to predict the performance of the RL policy training prior to the actual training on the physical robot. We achieve this by defining two novel measures, disentanglement and local linearity, for assessing the quality of generative models' latent spaces, and complementing them with the existing measures for evaluation of generative models. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on a picking task using several different generative models and determine which of their properties have the most influence on the final policy training. 

Title: Deep Stereo using Adaptive Thin Volume Representation with Uncertainty Awareness
Abstract:  We present Uncertainty-aware Cascaded Stereo Network (UCS-Net) for 3D reconstruction from multiple RGB images. Multi-view stereo (MVS) aims to reconstruct fine-grained scene geometry from multi-view images. Previous learning-based MVS methods estimate per-view depth using plane sweep volumes with a fixed depth hypothesis at each plane; this generally requires densely sampled planes for desired accuracy, and it is very hard to achieve high-resolution depth. In contrast, we propose adaptive thin volumes (ATVs); in an ATV, the depth hypothesis of each plane is spatially varying, which adapts to the uncertainties of previous per-pixel depth predictions. Our UCS-Net has three stages: the first stage processes a small standard plane sweep volume to predict low-resolution depth; two ATVs are then used in the following stages to refine the depth with higher resolution and higher accuracy. Our ATV consists of only a small number of planes; yet, it efficiently partitions local depth ranges within learned small intervals. In particular, we propose to use variance-based uncertainty estimates to adaptively construct ATVs; this differentiable process introduces reasonable and fine-grained spatial partitioning. Our multi-stage framework progressively subdivides the vast scene space with increasing depth resolution and precision, which enables scene reconstruction with high completeness and accuracy in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks on various challenging datasets. 

Title: Fault-Diagnosing SLAM for Varying Scale Change Detection
Abstract:  In this paper, we present a new fault diagnosis (FD) -based approach for detection of imagery changes that can detect significant changes as inconsistencies between different sub-modules (e.g., self-localizaiton) of visual SLAM. Unlike classical change detection approaches such as pairwise image comparison (PC) and anomaly detection (AD), neither the memorization of each map image nor the maintenance of up-to-date place-specific anomaly detectors are required in this FD approach. A significant challenge that is encountered when incorporating different SLAM sub-modules into FD involves dealing with the varying scales of objects that have changed (e.g., the appearance of small dangerous obstacles on the floor). To address this issue, we reconsider the bag-of-words (BoW) image representation, by exploiting its recent advances in terms of self-localization and change detection. As a key advantage, BoW image representation can be reorganized into any different scaling by simply cropping the original BoW image. Furthermore, we propose to combine different self-localization modules with strong and weak BoW features with different discriminativity, and to treat inconsistency between strong and weak self-localization as an indicator of change. The efficacy of the proposed approach for FD with/without AD and/or PC was experimentally validated. 

Title: DeepTemporalSeg: Temporally Consistent Semantic Segmentation of 3D LiDAR Scans
Abstract:  Understanding the semantic characteristics of the environment is a key enabler for autonomous robot operation. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for the semantic segmentation of a LiDAR scan into the classes car, pedestrian or bicyclist. This architecture is based on dense blocks and efficiently utilizes depth separable convolutions to limit the number of parameters while still maintaining state-of-the-art performance. To make the predictions from the DCNN temporally consistent, we propose a Bayes filter based method. This method uses the predictions from the neural network to recursively estimate the current semantic state of a point in a scan. This recursive estimation uses the knowledge gained from previous scans, thereby making the predictions temporally consistent and robust towards isolated erroneous predictions. We compare the performance of our proposed architecture with other state-of-the-art neural network architectures and report substantial improvement. For the proposed Bayes filter approach, we show results on various sequences in the KITTI tracking benchmark. 

Title: Learning Exploration Policies for Navigation
Abstract:  Numerous past works have tackled the problem of task-driven navigation. But, how to effectively explore a new environment to enable a variety of down-stream tasks has received much less attention. In this work, we study how agents can autonomously explore realistic and complex 3D environments without the context of task-rewards. We propose a learning-based approach and investigate different policy architectures, reward functions, and training paradigms. We find that the use of policies with spatial memory that are bootstrapped with imitation learning and finally finetuned with coverage rewards derived purely from on-board sensors can be effective at exploring novel environments. We show that our learned exploration policies can explore better than classical approaches based on geometry alone and generic learning-based exploration techniques. Finally, we also show how such task-agnostic exploration can be used for down-stream tasks. Code and Videos are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/exploration-for-nav. 

Title: 6D Camera Relocalization in Ambiguous Scenes via Continuous Multimodal Inference
Abstract:  We present a multimodal camera relocalization framework that captures ambiguities and uncertainties with continuous mixture models defined on the manifold of camera poses. In highly ambiguous environments, which can easily arise due to symmetries and repetitive structures in the scene, computing one plausible solution (what most state-of-the-art methods currently regress) may not be sufficient. Instead we predict multiple camera pose hypotheses as well as the respective uncertainty for each prediction. Towards this aim, we use Bingham distributions, to model the orientation of the camera pose, and a multivariate Gaussian to model the position, with an end-to-end deep neural network. By incorporating a Winner-Takes-All training scheme, we finally obtain a mixture model that is well suited for explaining ambiguities in the scene, yet does not suffer from mode collapse, a common problem with mixture density networks. We introduce a new dataset specifically designed to foster camera localization research in ambiguous environments and exhaustively evaluate our method on synthetic as well as real data on both ambiguous scenes and on non-ambiguous benchmark datasets. We plan to release our code and dataset under $\href{https://multimodal3dvision.github.io}{multimodal3dvision.github.io}$. 

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Safety-Critical Control under Model Uncertainty, using Control Lyapunov Functions and Control Barrier Functions
Abstract:  In this paper, the issue of model uncertainty in safety-critical control is addressed with a data-driven approach. For this purpose, we utilize the structure of an input-ouput linearization controller based on a nominal model along with a Control Barrier Function and Control Lyapunov Function based Quadratic Program (CBF-CLF-QP). Specifically, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework which learns the model uncertainty present in the CBF and CLF constraints, as well as other control-affine dynamic constraints in the quadratic program. The trained policy is combined with the nominal model-based CBF-CLF-QP, resulting in the Reinforcement Learning-based CBF-CLF-QP (RL-CBF-CLF-QP), which addresses the problem of model uncertainty in the safety constraints. The performance of the proposed method is validated by testing it on an underactuated nonlinear bipedal robot walking on randomly spaced stepping stones with one step preview, obtaining stable and safe walking under model uncertainty. 

Title: Deep Intrinsically Motivated Continuous Actor-Critic for Efficient Robotic Visuomotor Skill Learning
Abstract:  In this paper, we present a new intrinsically motivated actor-critic algorithm for learning continuous motor skills directly from raw visual input. Our neural architecture is composed of a critic and an actor network. Both networks receive the hidden representation of a deep convolutional autoencoder which is trained to reconstruct the visual input, while the centre-most hidden representation is also optimized to estimate the state value. Separately, an ensemble of predictive world models generates, based on its learning progress, an intrinsic reward signal which is combined with the extrinsic reward to guide the exploration of the actor-critic learner. Our approach is more data-efficient and inherently more stable than the existing actor-critic methods for continuous control from pixel data. We evaluate our algorithm for the task of learning robotic reaching and grasping skills on a realistic physics simulator and on a humanoid robot. The results show that the control policies learned with our approach can achieve better performance than the compared state-of-the-art and baseline algorithms in both dense-reward and challenging sparse-reward settings. 

Title: Risk Averse Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Deep reinforcement learning has recently made significant progress in solving computer games and robotic control tasks. A known problem, though, is that policies overfit to the training environment and may not avoid rare, catastrophic events such as automotive accidents. A classical technique for improving the robustness of reinforcement learning algorithms is to train on a set of randomized environments, but this approach only guards against common situations. Recently, robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL) was developed, which allows efficient applications of random and systematic perturbations by a trained adversary. A limitation of RARL is that only the expected control objective is optimized; there is no explicit modeling or optimization of risk. Thus the agents do not consider the probability of catastrophic events (i.e., those inducing abnormally large negative reward), except through their effect on the expected objective. In this paper we introduce risk-averse robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARARL), using a risk-averse protagonist and a risk-seeking adversary. We test our approach on a self-driving vehicle controller. We use an ensemble of policy networks to model risk as the variance of value functions. We show through experiments that a risk-averse agent is better equipped to handle a risk-seeking adversary, and experiences substantially fewer crashes compared to agents trained without an adversary. 

Title: Adaptive Navigation Scheme for Optimal Deep-Sea Localization Using Multimodal Perception Cues
Abstract:  Underwater robot interventions require a high level of safety and reliability. A major challenge to address is a robust and accurate acquisition of localization estimates, as it is a prerequisite to enable more complex tasks, e.g. floating manipulation and mapping. State-of-the-art navigation in commercial operations, such as oil & gas production (OGP), rely on costly instrumentation. These can be partially replaced or assisted by visual navigation methods, especially in deep-sea scenarios where equipment deployment has high costs and risks. Our work presents a multimodal approach that adapts state-of-the-art methods from on-land robotics, i.e., dense point cloud generation in combination with plane representation and registration, to boost underwater localization performance. A two-stage navigation scheme is proposed that initially generates a coarse probabilistic map of the workspace, which is used to filter noise from computed point clouds and planes in the second stage. Furthermore, an adaptive decision-making approach is introduced that determines which perception cues to incorporate into the localization filter to optimize accuracy and computation performance. Our approach is investigated first in simulation and then validated with data from field trials in OGP monitoring and maintenance scenarios. 

Title: Multi-task Learning with Gradient Guided Policy Specialization
Abstract:  We present a method for efficient learning of control policies for multiple related robotic motor skills. Our approach consists of two stages, joint training and specialization training. During the joint training stage, a neural network policy is trained with minimal information to disambiguate the motor skills. This forces the policy to learn a common representation of the different tasks. Then, during the specialization training stage we selectively split the weights of the policy based on a per-weight metric that measures the disagreement among the multiple tasks. By splitting part of the control policy, it can be further trained to specialize to each task. To update the control policy during learning, we use Trust Region Policy Optimization with Generalized Advantage Function (TRPOGAE). We propose a modification to the gradient update stage of TRPO to better accommodate multi-task learning scenarios. We evaluate our approach on three continuous motor skill learning problems in simulation: 1) a locomotion task where three single legged robots with considerable difference in shape and size are trained to hop forward, 2) a manipulation task where three robot manipulators with different sizes and joint types are trained to reach different locations in 3D space, and 3) locomotion of a two-legged robot, whose range of motion of one leg is constrained in different ways. We compare our training method to three baselines. The first baseline uses only joint training for the policy, the second trains independent policies for each task, and the last randomly selects weights to split. We show that our approach learns more efficiently than each of the baseline methods. 

Title: Continuous-Time Visual-Inertial Odometry for Event Cameras
Abstract:  Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that output pixel-level brightness changes instead of standard intensity frames. They offer significant advantages over standard cameras, namely a very high dynamic range, no motion blur, and a latency in the order of microseconds. However, due to the fundamentally different structure of the sensor's output, new algorithms that exploit the high temporal resolution and the asynchronous nature of the sensor are required. Recent work has shown that a continuous-time representation of the event camera pose can deal with the high temporal resolution and asynchronous nature of this sensor in a principled way. In this paper, we leverage such a continuous-time representation to perform visual-inertial odometry with an event camera. This representation allows direct integration of the asynchronous events with micro-second accuracy and the inertial measurements at high frequency. The event camera trajectory is approximated by a smooth curve in the space of rigid-body motions using cubic splines. This formulation significantly reduces the number of variables in trajectory estimation problems. We evaluate our method on real data from several scenes and compare the results against ground truth from a motion-capture system. We show that our method provides improved accuracy over the result of a state-of-the-art visual odometry method for event cameras. We also show that both the map orientation and scale can be recovered accurately by fusing events and inertial data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on visual-inertial fusion with event cameras using a continuous-time framework. 

Title: Informative Planning and Online Learning with Sparse Gaussian Processes
Abstract:  A big challenge in environmental monitoring is the spatiotemporal variation of the phenomena to be observed. To enable persistent sensing and estimation in such a setting, it is beneficial to have a time-varying underlying environmental model. Here we present a planning and learning method that enables an autonomous marine vehicle to perform persistent ocean monitoring tasks by learning and refining an environmental model. To alleviate the computational bottleneck caused by large-scale data accumulated, we propose a framework that iterates between a planning component aimed at collecting the most information-rich data, and a sparse Gaussian Process learning component where the environmental model and hyperparameters are learned online by taking advantage of only a subset of data that provides the greatest contribution. Our simulations with ground-truth ocean data shows that the proposed method is both accurate and efficient. 

Title: FPGA Architecture for Deep Learning and its application to Planetary Robotics
Abstract:  Autonomous control systems onboard planetary rovers and spacecraft benefit from having cognitive capabilities like learning so that they can adapt to unexpected situations in-situ. Q-learning is a form of reinforcement learning and it has been efficient in solving certain class of learning problems. However, embedded systems onboard planetary rovers and spacecraft rarely implement learning algorithms due to the constraints faced in the field, like processing power, chip size, convergence rate and costs due to the need for radiation hardening. These challenges present a compelling need for a portable, low-power, area efficient hardware accelerator to make learning algorithms practical onboard space hardware. This paper presents a FPGA implementation of Q-learning with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This method matches the massive parallelism inherent in neural network software with the fine-grain parallelism of an FPGA hardware thereby dramatically reducing processing time. Mars Science Laboratory currently uses Xilinx-Space-grade Virtex FPGA devices for image processing, pyrotechnic operation control and obstacle avoidance. We simulate and program our architecture on a Xilinx Virtex 7 FPGA. The architectural implementation for a single neuron Q-learning and a more complex Multilayer Perception (MLP) Q-learning accelerator has been demonstrated. The results show up to a 43-fold speed up by Virtex 7 FPGAs compared to a conventional Intel i5 2.3 GHz CPU. Finally, we simulate the proposed architecture using the Symphony simulator and compiler from Xilinx, and evaluate the performance and power consumption. 

Title: Enhanced free space detection in multiple lanes based on single CNN with scene identification
Abstract:  Many systems for autonomous vehicles' navigation rely on lane detection. Traditional algorithms usually estimate only the position of the lanes on the road, but an autonomous control system may also need to know if a lane marking can be crossed or not, and what portion of space inside the lane is free from obstacles, to make safer control decisions. On the other hand, free space detection algorithms only detect navigable areas, without information about lanes. State-of-the-art algorithms use CNNs for both tasks, with significant consumption of computing resources. We propose a novel approach that estimates the free space inside each lane, with a single CNN. Additionally, adding only a small requirement concerning GPU RAM, we infer the road type, that will be useful for path planning. To achieve this result, we train a multi-task CNN. Then, we further elaborate the output of the network, to extract polygons that can be effectively used in navigation control. Finally, we provide a computationally efficient implementation, based on ROS, that can be executed in real time. Our code and trained models are available online. 

Title: 3D Printed Brain-Controlled Robot-Arm Prosthetic via Embedded Deep Learning from sEMG Sensors
Abstract:  In this paper, we present our work on developing robot arm prosthetic via deep learning. Our work proposes to use transfer learning techniques applied to the Google Inception model to retrain the final layer for surface electromyography (sEMG) classification. Data have been collected using the Thalmic Labs Myo Armband and used to generate graph images comprised of 8 subplots per image containing sEMG data captured from 40 data points per sensor, corresponding to the array of 8 sEMG sensors in the armband. Data captured were then classified into four categories (Fist, Thumbs Up, Open Hand, Rest) via using a deep learning model, Inception-v3, with transfer learning to train the model for accurate prediction of each on real-time input of new data. This trained model was then downloaded to the ARM processor based embedding system to enable the brain-controlled robot-arm prosthetic manufactured from our 3D printer. Testing of the functionality of the method, a robotic arm was produced using a 3D printer and off-the-shelf hardware to control it. SSH communication protocols are employed to execute python files hosted on an embedded Raspberry Pi with ARM processors to trigger movement on the robot arm of the predicted gesture. 

Title: Baidu Apollo EM Motion Planner
Abstract:  In this manuscript, we introduce a real-time motion planning system based on the Baidu Apollo (open source) autonomous driving platform. The developed system aims to address the industrial level-4 motion planning problem while considering safety, comfort and scalability. The system covers multilane and single-lane autonomous driving in a hierarchical manner: (1) The top layer of the system is a multilane strategy that handles lane-change scenarios by comparing lane-level trajectories computed in parallel. (2) Inside the lane-level trajectory generator, it iteratively solves path and speed optimization based on a Frenet frame. (3) For path and speed optimization, a combination of dynamic programming and spline-based quadratic programming is proposed to construct a scalable and easy-to-tune framework to handle traffic rules, obstacle decisions and smoothness simultaneously. The planner is scalable to both highway and lower-speed city driving scenarios. We also demonstrate the algorithm through scenario illustrations and on-road test results. The system described in this manuscript has been deployed to dozens of Baidu Apollo autonomous driving vehicles since Apollo v1.5 was announced in September 2017. As of May 16th, 2018, the system has been tested under 3,380 hours and approximately 68,000 kilometers (42,253 miles) of closed-loop autonomous driving under various urban scenarios. The algorithm described in this manuscript is available at https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/tree/master/modules/planning. 

Title: DeepGait: Planning and Control of Quadrupedal Gaits using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  This paper addresses the problem of legged locomotion in non-flat terrain. As legged robots such as quadrupeds are to be deployed in terrains with geometries which are difficult to model and predict, the need arises to equip them with the capability to generalize well to unforeseen situations. In this work, we propose a novel technique for training neural-network policies for terrain-aware locomotion, which combines state-of-the-art methods for model-based motion planning and reinforcement learning. Our approach is centered on formulating Markov decision processes using the evaluation of dynamic feasibility criteria in place of physical simulation. We thus employ policy-gradient methods to independently train policies which respectively plan and execute foothold and base motions in 3D environments using both proprioceptive and exteroceptive measurements. We apply our method within a challenging suite of simulated terrain scenarios which contain features such as narrow bridges, gaps and stepping-stones, and train policies which succeed in locomoting effectively in all cases. 

Title: Noise-resistant Deep Learning for Object Classification in 3D Point Clouds Using a Point Pair Descriptor
Abstract:  Object retrieval and classification in point cloud data is challenged by noise, irregular sampling density and occlusion. To address this issue, we propose a point pair descriptor that is robust to noise and occlusion and achieves high retrieval accuracy. We further show how the proposed descriptor can be used in a 4D convolutional neural network for the task of object classification. We propose a novel 4D convolutional layer that is able to learn class-specific clusters in the descriptor histograms. Finally, we provide experimental validation on 3 benchmark datasets, which confirms the superiority of the proposed approach. 

Title: 3D Human Pose Estimation on a Configurable Bed from a Pressure Image
Abstract:  Robots have the potential to assist people in bed, such as in healthcare settings, yet bedding materials like sheets and blankets can make observation of the human body difficult for robots. A pressure-sensing mat on a bed can provide pressure images that are relatively insensitive to bedding materials. However, prior work on estimating human pose from pressure images has been restricted to 2D pose estimates and flat beds. In this work, we present two convolutional neural networks to estimate the 3D joint positions of a person in a configurable bed from a single pressure image. The first network directly outputs 3D joint positions, while the second outputs a kinematic model that includes estimated joint angles and limb lengths. We evaluated our networks on data from 17 human participants with two bed configurations: supine and seated. Our networks achieved a mean joint position error of 77 mm when tested with data from people outside the training set, outperforming several baselines. We also present a simple mechanical model that provides insight into ambiguity associated with limbs raised off of the pressure mat, and demonstrate that Monte Carlo dropout can be used to estimate pose confidence in these situations. Finally, we provide a demonstration in which a mobile manipulator uses our network's estimated kinematic model to reach a location on a person's body in spite of the person being seated in a bed and covered by a blanket. 

Title: SSP: Single Shot Future Trajectory Prediction
Abstract:  We propose a robust solution to future trajectory forecast, which can be practically applicable to autonomous agents in highly crowded environments. For this, three aspects are particularly addressed in this paper. First, we use composite fields to predict future locations of all road agents in a single-shot, which results in a constant time complexity, regardless of the number of agents in the scene. Second, interactions between agents are modeled as a non-local response, enabling spatial relationships between different locations to be captured temporally as well (i.e., in spatio-temporal interactions). Third, the semantic context of the scene are modeled and take into account the environmental constraints that potentially influence the future motion. To this end, we validate the robustness of the proposed approach using the ETH, UCY, and SDD datasets and highlight its practical functionality compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. 

Title: Avoidance of Manual Labeling in Robotic Autonomous Navigation Through Multi-Sensory Semi-Supervised Learning
Abstract:  Imitation learning holds the promise to address challenging robotic tasks such as autonomous navigation. It however requires a human supervisor to oversee the training process and send correct control commands to robots without feedback, which is always prone to error and expensive. To minimize human involvement and avoid manual labeling of data in the robotic autonomous navigation with imitation learning, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised imitation learning solution based on a multi-sensory design. This solution includes a suboptimal sensor policy based on sensor fusion to automatically label states encountered by a robot to avoid human supervision during training. In addition, a recording policy is developed to throttle the adversarial affect of learning too much from the suboptimal sensor policy. This solution allows the robot to learn a navigation policy in a self-supervised manner. With extensive experiments in indoor environments, this solution can achieve near human performance in most of the tasks and even surpasses human performance in case of unexpected events such as hardware failures or human operation errors. To best of our knowledge, this is the first work that synthesizes sensor fusion and imitation learning to enable robotic autonomous navigation in the real world without human supervision. 

Title: Imitation learning based on entropy-regularized forward and inverse reinforcement learning
Abstract:  This paper proposes Entropy-Regularized Imitation Learning (ERIL), which is a combination of forward and inverse reinforcement learning under the framework of the entropy-regularized Markov decision process. ERIL minimizes the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two probability distributions induced by a learner and an expert. Inverse reinforcement learning (RL) in ERIL evaluates the log-ratio between two distributions using the density ratio trick, which is widely used in generative adversarial networks. More specifically, the log-ratio is estimated by building two binary discriminators. The first discriminator is a state-only function, and it tries to distinguish the state generated by the forward RL step from the expert's state. The second discriminator is a function of current state, action, and transitioned state, and it distinguishes the generated experiences from the ones provided by the expert. Since the second discriminator has the same hyperparameters of the forward RL step, it can be used to control the discriminator's ability. The forward RL minimizes the reverse KL estimated by the inverse RL. We show that minimizing the reverse KL divergence is equivalent to finding an optimal policy under entropy regularization. Consequently, a new policy is derived from an algorithm that resembles Dynamic Policy Programming and Soft Actor-Critic. Our experimental results on MuJoCo-simulated environments show that ERIL is more sample-efficient than such previous methods. We further apply the method to human behaviors in performing a pole-balancing task and show that the estimated reward functions show how every subject achieves the goal. 

Title: Model-Reference Reinforcement Learning for Collision-Free Tracking Control of Autonomous Surface Vehicles
Abstract:  This paper presents a novel model-reference reinforcement learning algorithm for the intelligent tracking control of uncertain autonomous surface vehicles with collision avoidance. The proposed control algorithm combines a conventional control method with reinforcement learning to enhance control accuracy and intelligence. In the proposed control design, a nominal system is considered for the design of a baseline tracking controller using a conventional control approach. The nominal system also defines the desired behaviour of uncertain autonomous surface vehicles in an obstacle-free environment. Thanks to reinforcement learning, the overall tracking controller is capable of compensating for model uncertainties and achieving collision avoidance at the same time in environments with obstacles. In comparison to traditional deep reinforcement learning methods, our proposed learning-based control can provide stability guarantees and better sample efficiency. We demonstrate the performance of the new algorithm using an example of autonomous surface vehicles. 

Title: Compositional Transfer in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  The successful application of general reinforcement learning algorithms to real-world robotics applications is often limited by their high data requirements. We introduce Regularized Hierarchical Policy Optimization (RHPO) to improve data-efficiency for domains with multiple dominant tasks and ultimately reduce required platform time. To this end, we employ compositional inductive biases on multiple levels and corresponding mechanisms for sharing off-policy transition data across low-level controllers and tasks as well as scheduling of tasks. The presented algorithm enables stable and fast learning for complex, real-world domains in the parallel multitask and sequential transfer case. We show that the investigated types of hierarchy enable positive transfer while partially mitigating negative interference and evaluate the benefits of additional incentives for efficient, compositional task solutions in single task domains. Finally, we demonstrate substantial data-efficiency and final performance gains over competitive baselines in a week-long, physical robot stacking experiment. 

Title: Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Deep neural networks coupled with fast simulation and improved computation have led to recent successes in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). However, most current RL-based approaches fail to generalize since: (a) the gap between simulation and real world is so large that policy-learning approaches fail to transfer; (b) even if policy learning is done in real world, the data scarcity leads to failed generalization from training to test scenarios (e.g., due to different friction or object masses). Inspired from H-infinity control methods, we note that both modeling errors and differences in training and test scenarios can be viewed as extra forces/disturbances in the system. This paper proposes the idea of robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL), where we train an agent to operate in the presence of a destabilizing adversary that applies disturbance forces to the system. The jointly trained adversary is reinforced -- that is, it learns an optimal destabilization policy. We formulate the policy learning as a zero-sum, minimax objective function. Extensive experiments in multiple environments (InvertedPendulum, HalfCheetah, Swimmer, Hopper and Walker2d) conclusively demonstrate that our method (a) improves training stability; (b) is robust to differences in training/test conditions; and c) outperform the baseline even in the absence of the adversary. 

Title: se(3)-TrackNet: Data-driven 6D Pose Tracking by Calibrating Image Residuals in Synthetic Domains
Abstract:  Tracking the 6D pose of objects in video sequences is important for robot manipulation. This task, however, introduces multiple challenges: (i) robot manipulation involves significant occlusions; (ii) data and annotations are troublesome and difficult to collect for 6D poses, which complicates machine learning solutions, and (iii) incremental error drift often accumulates in long term tracking to necessitate re-initialization of the object's pose. This work proposes a data-driven optimization approach for long-term, 6D pose tracking. It aims to identify the optimal relative pose given the current RGB-D observation and a synthetic image conditioned on the previous best estimate and the object's model. The key contribution in this context is a novel neural network architecture, which appropriately disentangles the feature encoding to help reduce domain shift, and an effective 3D orientation representation via Lie Algebra. Consequently, even when the network is trained only with synthetic data can work effectively over real images. Comprehensive experiments over benchmarks - existing ones as well as a new dataset with significant occlusions related to object manipulation - show that the proposed approach achieves consistently robust estimates and outperforms alternatives, even though they have been trained with real images. The approach is also the most computationally efficient among the alternatives and achieves a tracking frequency of 90.9Hz. 

Title: Learning Domain Randomization Distributions for Training Robust Locomotion Policies
Abstract:  Domain randomization (DR) is a successful technique for learning robust policies for robot systems, when the dynamics of the target robot system are unknown. The success of policies trained with domain randomization however, is highly dependent on the correct selection of the randomization distribution. The majority of success stories typically use real world data in order to carefully select the DR distribution, or incorporate real world trajectories to better estimate appropriate randomization distributions. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding good domain randomization parameters for simulation, without prior access to data from the target system. We explore the use of gradient-based search methods to learn a domain randomization with the following properties: 1) The trained policy should be successful in environments sampled from the domain randomization distribution 2) The domain randomization distribution should be wide enough so that the experience similar to the target robot system is observed during training, while addressing the practicality of training finite capacity models. These two properties aim to ensure the trajectories encountered in the target system are close to those observed during training, as existing methods in machine learning are better suited for interpolation than extrapolation. We show how adapting the domain randomization distribution while training context-conditioned policies results in improvements on jump-start and asymptotic performance when transferring a learned policy to the target environment. 

Title: What is (missing or wrong) in the scene? A Hybrid Deep Boltzmann Machine For Contextualized Scene Modeling
Abstract:  Scene models allow robots to reason about what is in the scene, what else should be in it, and what should not be in it. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Boltzmann Machine (BM) for scene modeling where relations between objects are integrated. To be able to do that, we extend BM to include tri-way edges between visible (object) nodes and make the network to share the relations across different objects. We evaluate our method against several baseline models (Deep Boltzmann Machines, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines) on a scene classification dataset, and show that it performs better in several scene reasoning tasks. 

Title: Pedestrian Tracking by Probabilistic Data Association and Correspondence Embeddings
Abstract:  This paper studies the interplay between kinematics (position and velocity) and appearance cues for establishing correspondences in multi-target pedestrian tracking. We investigate tracking-by-detection approaches based on a deep learning detector, joint integrated probabilistic data association (JIPDA), and appearance-based tracking of deep correspondence embeddings. We first addressed the fixed-camera setup by fine-tuning a convolutional detector for accurate pedestrian detection and combining it with kinematic-only JIPDA. The resulting submission ranked first on the 3DMOT2015 benchmark. However, in sequences with a moving camera and unknown ego-motion, we achieved the best results by replacing kinematic cues with global nearest neighbor tracking of deep correspondence embeddings. We trained the embeddings by fine-tuning features from the second block of ResNet-18 using angular loss extended by a margin term. We note that integrating deep correspondence embeddings directly in JIPDA did not bring significant improvement. It appears that geometry of deep correspondence embeddings for soft data association needs further investigation in order to obtain the best from both worlds. 

Title: Is the Pedestrian going to Cross? Answering by 2D Pose Estimation
Abstract:  Our recent work suggests that, thanks to nowadays powerful CNNs, image-based 2D pose estimation is a promising cue for determining pedestrian intentions such as crossing the road in the path of the ego-vehicle, stopping before entering the road, and starting to walk or bending towards the road. This statement is based on the results obtained on non-naturalistic sequences (Daimler dataset), i.e. in sequences choreographed specifically for performing the study. Fortunately, a new publicly available dataset (JAAD) has appeared recently to allow developing methods for detecting pedestrian intentions in naturalistic driving conditions; more specifically, for addressing the relevant question is the pedestrian going to cross? Accordingly, in this paper we use JAAD to assess the usefulness of 2D pose estimation for answering such a question. We combine CNN-based pedestrian detection, tracking and pose estimation to predict the crossing action from monocular images. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides new state-of-the-art results. 

Title: Hindsight Experience Replay
Abstract:  Dealing with sparse rewards is one of the biggest challenges in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We present a novel technique called Hindsight Experience Replay which allows sample-efficient learning from rewards which are sparse and binary and therefore avoid the need for complicated reward engineering. It can be combined with an arbitrary off-policy RL algorithm and may be seen as a form of implicit curriculum. We demonstrate our approach on the task of manipulating objects with a robotic arm. In particular, we run experiments on three different tasks: pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place, in each case using only binary rewards indicating whether or not the task is completed. Our ablation studies show that Hindsight Experience Replay is a crucial ingredient which makes training possible in these challenging environments. We show that our policies trained on a physics simulation can be deployed on a physical robot and successfully complete the task. 

Title: Learning the sense of touch in simulation: a sim-to-real strategy for vision-based tactile sensing
Abstract:  Data-driven approaches to tactile sensing aim to overcome the complexity of accurately modeling contact with soft materials. However, their widespread adoption is impaired by concerns about data efficiency and the capability to generalize when applied to various tasks. This paper focuses on both these aspects with regard to a vision-based tactile sensor, which aims to reconstruct the distribution of the three-dimensional contact forces applied on its soft surface. Accurate models for the soft materials and the camera projection, derived via state-of-the-art techniques in the respective domains, are employed to generate a dataset in simulation. A strategy is proposed to train a tailored deep neural network entirely from the simulation data. The resulting learning architecture is directly transferable across multiple tactile sensors without further training and yields accurate predictions on real data, while showing promising generalization capabilities to unseen contact conditions. 

Title: Human Preference-Based Learning for High-dimensional Optimization of Exoskeleton Walking Gaits
Abstract:  Optimizing lower-body exoskeleton walking gaits for user comfort requires understanding users' preferences over a high-dimensional gait parameter space. However, existing preference-based learning methods have only explored low-dimensional domains due to computational limitations. To learn user preferences in high dimensions, this work presents LineCoSpar, a human-in-the-loop preference-based framework that enables optimization over many parameters by iteratively exploring one-dimensional subspaces. Additionally, this work identifies gait attributes that characterize broader preferences across users. In simulations and human trials, we empirically verify that LineCoSpar is a sample-efficient approach for high-dimensional preference optimization. Our analysis of the experimental data reveals a correspondence between human preferences and objective measures of dynamicity, while also highlighting differences in the utility functions underlying individual users' gait preferences. This result has implications for exoskeleton gait synthesis, an active field with applications to clinical use and patient rehabilitation. 

Title: The Cyborg Astrobiologist: Scouting Red Beds for Uncommon Features with Geological Significance
Abstract:  The `Cyborg Astrobiologist' (CA) has undergone a second geological field trial, at a red sandstone site in northern Guadalajara, Spain, near Riba de Santiuste. The Cyborg Astrobiologist is a wearable computer and video camera system that has demonstrated a capability to find uncommon interest points in geological imagery in real-time in the field. The first (of three) geological structures that we studied was an outcrop of nearly homogeneous sandstone, which exhibits oxidized-iron impurities in red and and an absence of these iron impurities in white. The white areas in these ``red beds'' have turned white because the iron has been removed by chemical reduction, perhaps by a biological agent. The computer vision system found in one instance several (iron-free) white spots to be uncommon and therefore interesting, as well as several small and dark nodules. The second geological structure contained white, textured mineral deposits on the surface of the sandstone, which were found by the CA to be interesting. The third geological structure was a 50 cm thick paleosol layer, with fossilized root structures of some plants, which were found by the CA to be interesting. A quasi-blind comparison of the Cyborg Astrobiologist's interest points for these images with the interest points determined afterwards by a human geologist shows that the Cyborg Astrobiologist concurred with the human geologist 68% of the time (true positive rate), with a 32% false positive rate and a 32% false negative rate. (abstract has been abridged). 

Title: Autonomous Driving in the Lung using Deep Learning for Localization
Abstract:  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and early diagnosis is critical to improving patient outcomes. To diagnose cancer, a highly trained pulmonologist must navigate a flexible bronchoscope deep into the branched structure of the lung for biopsy. The biopsy fails to sample the target tissue in 26-33% of cases largely because of poor registration with the preoperative CT map. To improve intraoperative registration, we develop two deep learning approaches to localize the bronchoscope in the preoperative CT map based on the bronchoscopic video in real-time, called AirwayNet and BifurcationNet. The networks are trained entirely on simulated images derived from the patient-specific CT. When evaluated on recorded bronchoscopy videos in a phantom lung, AirwayNet outperforms other deep learning localization algorithms with an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.97. Using AirwayNet, we demonstrate autonomous driving in the phantom lung based on video feedback alone. The robot reaches four targets in the left and right lungs in 95% of the trials. On recorded videos in eight human cadaver lungs, AirwayNet achieves areas under the precision-recall curve ranging from 0.82 to 0.997. 

Title: Egocentric Vision-based Future Vehicle Localization for Intelligent Driving Assistance Systems
Abstract:  Predicting the future location of vehicles is essential for safety-critical applications such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. This paper introduces a novel approach to simultaneously predict both the location and scale of target vehicles in the first-person (egocentric) view of an ego-vehicle. We present a multi-stream recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder-decoder model that separately captures both object location and scale and pixel-level observations for future vehicle localization. We show that incorporating dense optical flow improves prediction results significantly since it captures information about motion as well as appearance change. We also find that explicitly modeling future motion of the ego-vehicle improves the prediction accuracy, which could be especially beneficial in intelligent and automated vehicles that have motion planning capability. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we present a new dataset of first-person videos collected from a variety of scenarios at road intersections, which are particularly challenging moments for prediction because vehicle trajectories are diverse and dynamic. 

Title: A Visual Communication Map for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Multi-agent learning distinctly poses significant challenges in the effort to allocate a concealed communication medium. Agents receive thorough knowledge from the medium to determine subsequent actions in a distributed nature. Apparently, the goal is to leverage the cooperation of multiple agents to achieve a designated objective efficiently. Recent studies typically combine a specialized neural network with reinforcement learning to enable communication between agents. This approach, however, limits the number of agents or necessitates the homogeneity of the system. In this paper, we have proposed a more scalable approach that not only deals with a great number of agents but also enables collaboration between dissimilar functional agents and compatibly combined with any deep reinforcement learning methods. Specifically, we create a global communication map to represent the status of each agent in the system visually. The visual map and the environmental state are fed to a shared-parameter network to train multiple agents concurrently. Finally, we select the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm to demonstrate our proposed scheme, namely Visual communication map for Multi-agent A3C (VMA3C). Simulation results show that the use of visual communication map improves the performance of A3C regarding learning speed, reward achievement, and robustness in multi-agent problems. 

Title: Gait learning for soft microrobots controlled by light fields
Abstract:  Soft microrobots based on photoresponsive materials and controlled by light fields can generate a variety of different gaits. This inherent flexibility can be exploited to maximize their locomotion performance in a given environment and used to adapt them to changing conditions. Albeit, because of the lack of accurate locomotion models, and given the intrinsic variability among microrobots, analytical control design is not possible. Common data-driven approaches, on the other hand, require running prohibitive numbers of experiments and lead to very sample-specific results. Here we propose a probabilistic learning approach for light-controlled soft microrobots based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Gaussian Processes (GPs). The proposed approach results in a learning scheme that is data-efficient, enabling gait optimization with a limited experimental budget, and robust against differences among microrobot samples. These features are obtained by designing the learning scheme through the comparison of different GP priors and BO settings on a semi-synthetic data set. The developed learning scheme is validated in microrobot experiments, resulting in a 115% improvement in a microrobot's locomotion performance with an experimental budget of only 20 tests. These encouraging results lead the way toward self-adaptive microrobotic systems based on light-controlled soft microrobots and probabilistic learning control. 

Title: CORe50: a New Dataset and Benchmark for Continuous Object Recognition
Abstract:  Continuous/Lifelong learning of high-dimensional data streams is a challenging research problem. In fact, fully retraining models each time new data become available is infeasible, due to computational and storage issues, while na\"ive incremental strategies have been shown to suffer from catastrophic forgetting. In the context of real-world object recognition applications (e.g., robotic vision), where continuous learning is crucial, very few datasets and benchmarks are available to evaluate and compare emerging techniques. In this work we propose a new dataset and benchmark CORe50, specifically designed for continuous object recognition, and introduce baseline approaches for different continuous learning scenarios. 

Title: Learning to Fly by Crashing
Abstract:  How do you learn to navigate an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and avoid obstacles? One approach is to use a small dataset collected by human experts: however, high capacity learning algorithms tend to overfit when trained with little data. An alternative is to use simulation. But the gap between simulation and real world remains large especially for perception problems. The reason most research avoids using large-scale real data is the fear of crashes! In this paper, we propose to bite the bullet and collect a dataset of crashes itself! We build a drone whose sole purpose is to crash into objects: it samples naive trajectories and crashes into random objects. We crash our drone 11,500 times to create one of the biggest UAV crash dataset. This dataset captures the different ways in which a UAV can crash. We use all this negative flying data in conjunction with positive data sampled from the same trajectories to learn a simple yet powerful policy for UAV navigation. We show that this simple self-supervised model is quite effective in navigating the UAV even in extremely cluttered environments with dynamic obstacles including humans.

Title: RGB-D Odometry and SLAM
Abstract:  The emergence of modern RGB-D sensors had a significant impact in many application fields, including robotics, augmented reality (AR) and 3D scanning. They are low-cost, low-power and low-size alternatives to traditional range sensors such as LiDAR. Moreover, unlike RGB cameras, RGB-D sensors provide the additional depth information that removes the need of frame-by-frame triangulation for 3D scene reconstruction. These merits have made them very popular in mobile robotics and AR, where it is of great interest to estimate ego-motion and 3D scene structure. Such spatial understanding can enable robots to navigate autonomously without collisions and allow users to insert virtual entities consistent with the image stream. In this chapter, we review common formulations of odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (known by its acronym SLAM) using RGB-D stream input. The two topics are closely related, as the former aims to track the incremental camera motion with respect to a local map of the scene, and the latter to jointly estimate the camera trajectory and the global map with consistency. In both cases, the standard approaches minimize a cost function using nonlinear optimization techniques. This chapter consists of three main parts: In the first part, we introduce the basic concept of odometry and SLAM and motivate the use of RGB-D sensors. We also give mathematical preliminaries relevant to most odometry and SLAM algorithms. In the second part, we detail the three main components of SLAM systems: camera pose tracking, scene mapping and loop closing. For each component, we describe different approaches proposed in the literature. In the final part, we provide a brief discussion on advanced research topics with the references to the state-of-the-art. 

Title: Camera-Lidar Integration: Probabilistic sensor fusion for semantic mapping
Abstract:  An automated vehicle operating in an urban environment must be able to perceive and recognise object/obstacles in a three-dimensional world while navigating in a constantly changing environment. In order to plan and execute accurate sophisticated driving maneuvers, a high-level contextual understanding of the surroundings is essential. Due to the recent progress in image processing, it is now possible to obtain high definition semantic information in 2D from monocular cameras, though cameras cannot reliably provide the highly accurate 3D information provided by lasers. The fusion of these two sensor modalities can overcome the shortcomings of each individual sensor, though there are a number of important challenges that need to be addressed in a probabilistic manner. In this paper, we address the common, yet challenging, lidar/camera/semantic fusion problems which are seldom approached in a wholly probabilistic manner. Our approach is capable of using a multi-sensor platform to build a three-dimensional semantic voxelized map that considers the uncertainty of all of the processes involved. We present a probabilistic pipeline that incorporates uncertainties from the sensor readings (cameras, lidar, IMU and wheel encoders), compensation for the motion of the vehicle, and heuristic label probabilities for the semantic images. We also present a novel and efficient viewpoint validation algorithm to check for occlusions from the camera frames. A probabilistic projection is performed from the camera images to the lidar point cloud. Each labelled lidar scan then feeds into an octree map building algorithm that updates the class probabilities of the map voxels every time a new observation is available. We validate our approach using a set of qualitative and quantitative experimental tests on the USyd Dataset. 

Title: Variable Compliance Control for Robotic Peg-in-Hole Assembly: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach
Abstract:  Industrial robot manipulators are playing a more significant role in modern manufacturing industries. Though peg-in-hole assembly is a common industrial task which has been extensively researched, safely solving complex high precision assembly in an unstructured environment remains an open problem. Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have been proven successful in solving manipulation tasks autonomously. However, RL is still not widely adopted on real robotic systems because working with real hardware entails additional challenges, especially when using position-controlled manipulators. The main contribution of this work is a learning-based method to solve peg-in-hole tasks with position uncertainty of the hole. We proposed the use of an off-policy model-free reinforcement learning method and bootstrap the training speed by using several transfer learning techniques (sim2real) and domain randomization. Our proposed learning framework for position-controlled robots was extensively evaluated on contact-rich insertion tasks on a variety of environments. 

Title: Hybrid Repeat/Multi-point Sampling for Highly Volatile Objective Functions
Abstract:  A key drawback of the current generation of artificial decision-makers is that they do not adapt well to changes in unexpected situations. This paper addresses the situation in which an AI for aerial dog fighting, with tunable parameters that govern its behavior, will optimize behavior with respect to an objective function that must be evaluated and learned through simulations. Once this objective function has been modeled, the agent can then choose its desired behavior in different situations. Bayesian optimization with a Gaussian Process surrogate is used as the method for investigating the objective function. One key benefit is that during optimization the Gaussian Process learns a global estimate of the true objective function, with predicted outcomes and a statistical measure of confidence in areas that haven't been investigated yet. However, standard Bayesian optimization does not perform consistently or provide an accurate Gaussian Process surrogate function for highly volatile objective functions. We treat these problems by introducing a novel sampling technique called Hybrid Repeat/Multi-point Sampling. This technique gives the AI ability to learn optimum behaviors in a highly uncertain environment. More importantly, it not only improves the reliability of the optimization, but also creates a better model of the entire objective surface. With this improved model the agent is equipped to better adapt behaviors. 

Title: Visual-Inertial Mapping with Non-Linear Factor Recovery
Abstract:  Cameras and inertial measurement units are complementary sensors for ego-motion estimation and environment mapping. Their combination makes visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems more accurate and robust. For globally consistent mapping, however, combining visual and inertial information is not straightforward. To estimate the motion and geometry with a set of images large baselines are required. Because of that, most systems operate on keyframes that have large time intervals between each other. Inertial data on the other hand quickly degrades with the duration of the intervals and after several seconds of integration, it typically contains only little useful information. In this paper, we propose to extract relevant information for visual-inertial mapping from visual-inertial odometry using non-linear factor recovery. We reconstruct a set of non-linear factors that make an optimal approximation of the information on the trajectory accumulated by VIO. To obtain a globally consistent map we combine these factors with loop-closing constraints using bundle adjustment. The VIO factors make the roll and pitch angles of the global map observable, and improve the robustness and the accuracy of the mapping. In experiments on a public benchmark, we demonstrate superior performance of our method over the state-of-the-art approaches. 

Title: Visual Place Recognition with Probabilistic Vertex Voting
Abstract:  We propose a novel scoring concept for visual place recognition based on nearest neighbor descriptor voting and demonstrate how the algorithm naturally emerges from the problem formulation. Based on the observation that the number of votes for matching places can be evaluated using a binomial distribution model, loop closures can be detected with high precision. By casting the problem into a probabilistic framework, we not only remove the need for commonly employed heuristic parameters but also provide a powerful score to classify matching and non-matching places. We present methods for both a 2D-2D pose-graph vertex matching and a 2D-3D landmark matching based on the above scoring. The approach maintains accuracy while being efficient enough for online application through the use of compact (low dimensional) descriptors and fast nearest neighbor retrieval techniques. The proposed methods are evaluated on several challenging datasets in varied environments, showing state-of-the-art results with high precision and high recall. 

Title: Self-Supervised Monocular Scene Flow Estimation
Abstract:  Scene flow estimation has been receiving increasing attention for 3D environment perception. Monocular scene flow estimation -- obtaining 3D structure and 3D motion from two temporally consecutive images -- is a highly ill-posed problem, and practical solutions are lacking to date. We propose a novel monocular scene flow method that yields competitive accuracy and real-time performance. By taking an inverse problem view, we design a single convolutional neural network (CNN) that successfully estimates depth and 3D motion simultaneously from a classical optical flow cost volume. We adopt self-supervised learning with 3D loss functions and occlusion reasoning to leverage unlabeled data. We validate our design choices, including the proxy loss and augmentation setup. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among unsupervised/self-supervised learning approaches to monocular scene flow, and yields competitive results for the optical flow and monocular depth estimation sub-tasks. Semi-supervised fine-tuning further improves the accuracy and yields promising results in real-time. 

Title: Maximum Likelihood Constraint Inference for Inverse Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  While most approaches to the problem of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) focus on estimating a reward function that best explains an expert agent's policy or demonstrated behavior on a control task, it is often the case that such behavior is more succinctly represented by a simple reward combined with a set of hard constraints. In this setting, the agent is attempting to maximize cumulative rewards subject to these given constraints on their behavior. We reformulate the problem of IRL on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) such that, given a nominal model of the environment and a nominal reward function, we seek to estimate state, action, and feature constraints in the environment that motivate an agent's behavior. Our approach is based on the Maximum Entropy IRL framework, which allows us to reason about the likelihood of an expert agent's demonstrations given our knowledge of an MDP. Using our method, we can infer which constraints can be added to the MDP to most increase the likelihood of observing these demonstrations. We present an algorithm which iteratively infers the Maximum Likelihood Constraint to best explain observed behavior, and we evaluate its efficacy using both simulated behavior and recorded data of humans navigating around an obstacle. 

Title: Learning Multi-Level Hierarchies with Hindsight
Abstract:  Hierarchical agents have the potential to solve sequential decision making tasks with greater sample efficiency than their non-hierarchical counterparts because hierarchical agents can break down tasks into sets of subtasks that only require short sequences of decisions. In order to realize this potential of faster learning, hierarchical agents need to be able to learn their multiple levels of policies in parallel so these simpler subproblems can be solved simultaneously. Yet, learning multiple levels of policies in parallel is hard because it is inherently unstable: changes in a policy at one level of the hierarchy may cause changes in the transition and reward functions at higher levels in the hierarchy, making it difficult to jointly learn multiple levels of policies. In this paper, we introduce a new Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) framework, Hierarchical Actor-Critic (HAC), that can overcome the instability issues that arise when agents try to jointly learn multiple levels of policies. The main idea behind HAC is to train each level of the hierarchy independently of the lower levels by training each level as if the lower level policies are already optimal. We demonstrate experimentally in both grid world and simulated robotics domains that our approach can significantly accelerate learning relative to other non-hierarchical and hierarchical methods. Indeed, our framework is the first to successfully learn 3-level hierarchies in parallel in tasks with continuous state and action spaces. 

Title: Vision-and-Language Navigation: Interpreting visually-grounded navigation instructions in real environments
Abstract:  A robot that can carry out a natural-language instruction has been a dream since before the Jetsons cartoon series imagined a life of leisure mediated by a fleet of attentive robot helpers. It is a dream that remains stubbornly distant. However, recent advances in vision and language methods have made incredible progress in closely related areas. This is significant because a robot interpreting a natural-language navigation instruction on the basis of what it sees is carrying out a vision and language process that is similar to Visual Question Answering. Both tasks can be interpreted as visually grounded sequence-to-sequence translation problems, and many of the same methods are applicable. To enable and encourage the application of vision and language methods to the problem of interpreting visually-grounded navigation instructions, we present the Matterport3D Simulator -- a large-scale reinforcement learning environment based on real imagery. Using this simulator, which can in future support a range of embodied vision and language tasks, we provide the first benchmark dataset for visually-grounded natural language navigation in real buildings -- the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset. 

Title: Learning to Fly via Deep Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Learning to control robots without requiring engineered models has been a long-term goal, promising diverse and novel applications. Yet, reinforcement learning has only achieved limited impact on real-time robot control due to its high demand of real-world interactions. In this work, by leveraging a learnt probabilistic model of drone dynamics, we learn a thrust-attitude controller for a quadrotor through model-based reinforcement learning. No prior knowledge of the flight dynamics is assumed; instead, a sequential latent variable model, used generatively and as an online filter, is learnt from raw sensory input. The controller and value function are optimised entirely by propagating stochastic analytic gradients through generated latent trajectories. We show that "learning to fly" can be achieved with less than 30 minutes of experience with a single drone, and can be deployed solely using onboard computational resources and sensors, on a self-built drone. 

Title: TNT: Target-driveN Trajectory Prediction
Abstract:  Predicting the future behavior of moving agents is essential for real world applications. It is challenging as the intent of the agent and the corresponding behavior is unknown and intrinsically multimodal. Our key insight is that for prediction within a moderate time horizon, the future modes can be effectively captured by a set of target states. This leads to our target-driven trajectory prediction (TNT) framework. TNT has three stages which are trained end-to-end. It first predicts an agent's potential target states $T$ steps into the future, by encoding its interactions with the environment and the other agents. TNT then generates trajectory state sequences conditioned on targets. A final stage estimates trajectory likelihoods and a final compact set of trajectory predictions is selected. This is in contrast to previous work which models agent intents as latent variables, and relies on test-time sampling to generate diverse trajectories. We benchmark TNT on trajectory prediction of vehicles and pedestrians, where we outperform state-of-the-art on Argoverse Forecasting, INTERACTION, Stanford Drone and an in-house Pedestrian-at-Intersection dataset. 

Title: Self-Driving Car Steering Angle Prediction Based on Image Recognition
Abstract:  Self-driving vehicles have expanded dramatically over the last few years. Udacity has release a dataset containing, among other data, a set of images with the steering angle captured during driving. The Udacity challenge aimed to predict steering angle based on only the provided images. We explore two different models to perform high quality prediction of steering angles based on images using different deep learning techniques including Transfer Learning, 3D CNN, LSTM and ResNet. If the Udacity challenge was still ongoing, both of our models would have placed in the top ten of all entries. 

Title: Learning to Generalize Across Long-Horizon Tasks from Human Demonstrations
Abstract:  Imitation learning is an effective and safe technique to train robot policies in the real world because it does not depend on an expensive random exploration process. However, due to the lack of exploration, learning policies that generalize beyond the demonstrated behaviors is still an open challenge. We present a novel imitation learning framework to enable robots to 1) learn complex real world manipulation tasks efficiently from a small number of human demonstrations, and 2) synthesize new behaviors not contained in the collected demonstrations. Our key insight is that multi-task domains often present a latent structure, where demonstrated trajectories for different tasks intersect at common regions of the state space. We present Generalization Through Imitation (GTI), a two-stage offline imitation learning algorithm that exploits this intersecting structure to train goal-directed policies that generalize to unseen start and goal state combinations. In the first stage of GTI, we train a stochastic policy that leverages trajectory intersections to have the capacity to compose behaviors from different demonstration trajectories together. In the second stage of GTI, we collect a small set of rollouts from the unconditioned stochastic policy of the first stage, and train a goal-directed agent to generalize to novel start and goal configurations. We validate GTI in both simulated domains and a challenging long-horizon robotic manipulation domain in the real world.

Title: Playing Soccer without Colors in the SPL: A Convolutional Neural Network Approach
Abstract:  The goal of this paper is to propose a vision system for humanoid robotic soccer that does not use any color information. The main features of this system are: (i) real-time operation in the NAO robot, and (ii) the ability to detect the ball, the robots, their orientations, the lines and key field features robustly. Our ball detector, robot detector, and robot's orientation detector obtain the highest reported detection rates. The proposed vision system is tested in a SPL field with several NAO robots under realistic and highly demanding conditions. The obtained results are: robot detection rate of 94.90%, ball detection rate of 97.10%, and a completely perceived orientation rate of 99.88% when the observed robot is static, and 95.52% when the observed robot is moving. 

Title: Approximate LSTMs for Time-Constrained Inference: Enabling Fast Reaction in Self-Driving Cars
Abstract:  The need to recognise long-term dependencies in sequential data such as video streams has made Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks a prominent Artificial Intelligence model for many emerging applications. However, the high computational and memory demands of LSTMs introduce challenges in their deployment on latency-critical systems such as self-driving cars which are equipped with limited computational resources on-board. In this paper, we introduce a progressive inference computing scheme that combines model pruning and computation restructuring leading to the best possible approximation of the result given the available latency budget of the target application. The proposed methodology enables mission-critical systems to make informed decisions even in early stages of the computation, based on approximate LSTM inference, meeting their specifications on safety and robustness. Our experiments on a state-of-the-art driving model for autonomous vehicle navigation demonstrate that the proposed approach can yield outputs with similar quality of result compared to a faithful LSTM baseline, up to 415x faster (198x on average, 76x geo. mean). 

Title: A Deep Neural Network for Finger Counting and Numerosity Estimation
Abstract:  In this paper, we present neuro-robotics models with a deep artificial neural network capable of generating finger counting positions and number estimation. We first train the model in an unsupervised manner where each layer is treated as a Restricted Boltzmann Machine or an autoencoder. Such a model is further trained in a supervised way. This type of pre-training is tested on our baseline model and two methods of pre-training are compared. The network is extended to produce finger counting positions. The performance in number estimation of such an extended model is evaluated. We test the hypothesis if the subitizing process can be obtained by one single model used also for estimation of higher numerosities. The results confirm the importance of unsupervised training in our enumeration task and show some similarities to human behaviour in the case of subitizing. 

Title: Speeding Up Iterative Closest Point Using Stochastic Gradient Descent
Abstract:  Sensors producing 3D point clouds such as 3D laser scanners and RGB-D cameras are widely used in robotics, be it for autonomous driving or manipulation. Aligning point clouds produced by these sensors is a vital component in such applications to perform tasks such as model registration, pose estimation, and SLAM. Iterative closest point (ICP) is the most widely used method for this task, due to its simplicity and efficiency. In this paper we propose a novel method which solves the optimisation problem posed by ICP using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Using SGD allows us to improve the convergence speed of ICP without sacrificing solution quality. Experiments using Kinect as well as Velodyne data show that, our proposed method is faster than existing methods, while obtaining solutions comparable to standard ICP. An additional benefit is robustness to parameters when processing data from different sensors. 

Title: Joint 3D Tracking and Forecasting with Graph Neural Network and Diversity Sampling
Abstract:  3D multi-object tracking (MOT) and trajectory forecasting are two critical components in modern 3D perception systems that require accurate modeling of multi-agent interaction. We hypothesize that it is beneficial to unify both tasks under one framework in order to learn a shared feature representation of agent interaction. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose a unified solution for 3D MOT and trajectory forecasting which also incorporates two additional novel computational units. First, we propose a feature interaction technique by introducing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the way in which multiple agents interact with one another. The GNN is able to model complex hierarchical interactions, improve the discriminative feature learning for MOT association, and provide socially-aware context for trajectory forecasting. Second, we use a diversity sampling function to improve the quality and diversity of our forecasted trajectories. The learned sampling function is trained to efficiently extract a variety of outcomes from a generative trajectory distribution and helps avoid the problem of generating many duplicate trajectory samples. We evaluate on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, showing that our unified method with feature interaction and diversity sampling achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both 3D MOT and trajectory forecasting. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/xinshuoweng/GNNTrkForecast. 

Title: Embodied Multimodal Multitask Learning
Abstract:  Recent efforts on training visual navigation agents conditioned on language using deep reinforcement learning have been successful in learning policies for different multimodal tasks, such as semantic goal navigation and embodied question answering. In this paper, we propose a multitask model capable of jointly learning these multimodal tasks, and transferring knowledge of words and their grounding in visual objects across the tasks. The proposed model uses a novel Dual-Attention unit to disentangle the knowledge of words in the textual representations and visual concepts in the visual representations, and align them with each other. This disentangled task-invariant alignment of representations facilitates grounding and knowledge transfer across both tasks. We show that the proposed model outperforms a range of baselines on both tasks in simulated 3D environments. We also show that this disentanglement of representations makes our model modular, interpretable, and allows for transfer to instructions containing new words by leveraging object detectors. 

Title: Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Multi-Robot Object Manipulation
Abstract:  We consider solving a cooperative multi-robot object manipulation task using reinforcement learning (RL). We propose two distributed multi-agent RL approaches: distributed approximate RL (DA-RL), where each agent applies Q-learning with individual reward functions; and game-theoretic RL (GT-RL), where the agents update their Q-values based on the Nash equilibrium of a bimatrix Q-value game. We validate the proposed approaches in the setting of cooperative object manipulation with two simulated robot arms. Although we focus on a small system of two agents in this paper, both DA-RL and GT-RL apply to general multi-agent systems, and are expected to scale well to large systems. 

Title: Sparse Depth Enhanced Direct Thermal-infrared SLAM Beyond the Visible Spectrum
Abstract:  In this paper, we propose a thermal-infrared simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system enhanced by sparse depth measurements from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). Thermal-infrared cameras are relatively robust against fog, smoke, and dynamic lighting conditions compared to RGB cameras operating under the visible spectrum. Due to the advantages of thermal-infrared cameras, exploiting them for motion estimation and mapping is highly appealing. However, operating a thermal-infrared camera directly in existing vision-based methods is difficult because of the modality difference. This paper proposes a method to use sparse depth measurement for 6-DOF motion estimation by directly tracking under 14- bit raw measurement of the thermal camera. In addition, we perform a refinement to improve the local accuracy and include a loop closure to maintain global consistency. The experimental results demonstrate that the system is not only robust under various lighting conditions such as day and night, but also overcomes the scale problem of monocular cameras.

Title: Open3D: A Modern Library for 3D Data Processing
Abstract:  Open3D is an open-source library that supports rapid development of software that deals with 3D data. The Open3D frontend exposes a set of carefully selected data structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python. The backend is highly optimized and is set up for parallelization. Open3D was developed from a clean slate with a small and carefully considered set of dependencies. It can be set up on different platforms and compiled from source with minimal effort. The code is clean, consistently styled, and maintained via a clear code review mechanism. Open3D has been used in a number of published research projects and is actively deployed in the cloud. We welcome contributions from the open-source community. 

Title: Fast Deep Stereo with 2D Convolutional Processing of Cost Signatures
Abstract:  Modern neural network-based algorithms are able to produce highly accurate depth estimates from stereo image pairs, nearly matching the reliability of measurements from more expensive depth sensors. However, this accuracy comes with a higher computational cost since these methods use network architectures designed to compute and process matching scores across all candidate matches at all locations, with floating point computations repeated across a match volume with dimensions corresponding to both space and disparity. This leads to longer running times to process each image pair, making them impractical for real-time use in robots and autonomous vehicles. We propose a new stereo algorithm that employs a significantly more efficient network architecture. Our method builds an initial match cost volume using traditional matching costs that are fast to compute, and trains a network to estimate disparity from this volume. Crucially, our network only employs per-pixel and two-dimensional convolution operations: to summarize the match information at each location as a low-dimensional feature vector, and to spatially process these `cost-signature' features to produce a dense disparity map. Experimental results on the KITTI benchmark show that our method delivers competitive accuracy at significantly higher speeds---running at 48 frames per second on a modern GPU. 

Title: Fast Cylinder and Plane Extraction from Depth Cameras for Visual Odometry
Abstract:  This paper presents CAPE, a method to extract planes and cylinder segments from organized point clouds, which processes 640x480 depth images on a single CPU core at an average of 300 Hz, by operating on a grid of planar cells. While, compared to state-of-the-art plane extraction, the latency of CAPE is more consistent and 4-10 times faster, depending on the scene, we also demonstrate empirically that applying CAPE to visual odometry can improve trajectory estimation on scenes made of cylindrical surfaces (e.g. tunnels), whereas using a plane extraction approach that is not curve-aware deteriorates performance on these scenes. To use these geometric primitives in visual odometry, we propose extending a probabilistic RGB-D odometry framework based on points, lines and planes to cylinder primitives. Following this framework, CAPE runs on fused depth maps and the parameters of cylinders are modelled probabilistically to account for uncertainty and weight accordingly the pose optimization residuals. 

Title: Realistic Physics Based Character Controller
Abstract:  Over the course of the last several years there was a strong interest in application of modern optimal control techniques to the field of character animation. This interest was fueled by introduction of efficient learning based algorithms for policy optimization, growth in computation power, and game engine improvements. It was shown that it is possible to generate natural looking control of a character by using two ingredients. First, the simulated agent must adhere to a motion capture dataset. And second, the character aims to track the control input from the user. The paper aims at closing the gap between the researchers and users by introducing an open source implementation of physics based character control in Unity framework that has a low entry barrier and a steep learning curve. 

Title: Visual Tracking with Similarity Matching Ratio
Abstract:  This paper presents a novel approach to visual tracking: Similarity Matching Ratio (SMR). The traditional approach of tracking is minimizing some measures of the difference between the template and a patch from the frame. This approach is vulnerable to outliers and drastic appearance changes and an extensive study is focusing on making the approach more tolerant to them. However, this often results in longer, corrective algo- rithms which do not solve the original problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to the definition of the tracking problems, SMR, which turns the differences into a probability measure. Only pixel differences below a threshold count towards deciding the match, the rest are ignored. This approach makes the SMR tracker robust to outliers and points that dramaticaly change appearance. The SMR tracker is tested on challenging video sequences and achieved state-of-the-art performance. 

Title: Learning Multiplicative Interactions with Bayesian Neural Networks for Visual-Inertial Odometry
Abstract:  This paper presents an end-to-end multi-modal learning approach for monocular Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), which is specifically designed to exploit sensor complementarity in the light of sensor degradation scenarios. The proposed network makes use of a multi-head self-attention mechanism that learns multiplicative interactions between multiple streams of information. Another design feature of our approach is the incorporation of the model uncertainty using scalable Laplace Approximation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach by comparing it against the end-to-end state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI dataset and show that it achieves superior performance. Importantly, our work thereby provides an empirical evidence that learning multiplicative interactions can result in a powerful inductive bias for increased robustness to sensor failures. 

Title: Human Motion Capture Using a Drone
Abstract:  Current motion capture (MoCap) systems generally require markers and multiple calibrated cameras, which can be used only in constrained environments. In this work we introduce a drone-based system for 3D human MoCap. The system only needs an autonomously flying drone with an on-board RGB camera and is usable in various indoor and outdoor environments. A reconstruction algorithm is developed to recover full-body motion from the video recorded by the drone. We argue that, besides the capability of tracking a moving subject, a flying drone also provides fast varying viewpoints, which is beneficial for motion reconstruction. We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system using our new DroCap dataset and also demonstrate its applicability for MoCap in the wild using a consumer drone. 

Title: Differentiable Mapping Networks: Learning Structured Map Representations for Sparse Visual Localization
Abstract:  Mapping and localization, preferably from a small number of observations, are fundamental tasks in robotics. We address these tasks by combining spatial structure (differentiable mapping) and end-to-end learning in a novel neural network architecture: the Differentiable Mapping Network (DMN). The DMN constructs a spatially structured view-embedding map and uses it for subsequent visual localization with a particle filter. Since the DMN architecture is end-to-end differentiable, we can jointly learn the map representation and localization using gradient descent. We apply the DMN to sparse visual localization, where a robot needs to localize in a new environment with respect to a small number of images from known viewpoints. We evaluate the DMN using simulated environments and a challenging real-world Street View dataset. We find that the DMN learns effective map representations for visual localization. The benefit of spatial structure increases with larger environments, more viewpoints for mapping, and when training data is scarce.

Title: Kimera: an Open-Source Library for Real-Time Metric-Semantic Localization and Mapping
Abstract:  We provide an open-source C++ library for real-time metric-semantic visual-inertial Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). The library goes beyond existing visual and visual-inertial SLAM libraries (e.g., ORB-SLAM, VINS- Mono, OKVIS, ROVIO) by enabling mesh reconstruction and semantic labeling in 3D. Kimera is designed with modularity in mind and has four key components: a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) module for fast and accurate state estimation, a robust pose graph optimizer for global trajectory estimation, a lightweight 3D mesher module for fast mesh reconstruction, and a dense 3D metric-semantic reconstruction module. The modules can be run in isolation or in combination, hence Kimera can easily fall back to a state-of-the-art VIO or a full SLAM system. Kimera runs in real-time on a CPU and produces a 3D metric-semantic mesh from semantically labeled images, which can be obtained by modern deep learning methods. We hope that the flexibility, computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy afforded by Kimera will build a solid basis for future metric-semantic SLAM and perception research, and will allow researchers across multiple areas (e.g., VIO, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, segmentation) to benchmark and prototype their own efforts without having to start from scratch. 

Title: Socially Aware Kalman Neural Networks for Trajectory Prediction
Abstract:  Trajectory prediction is a critical technique in the navigation of robots and autonomous vehicles. However, the complex traffic and dynamic uncertainties yield challenges in the effectiveness and robustness in modeling. We purpose a data-driven approach socially aware Kalman neural networks (SAKNN) where the interaction layer and the Kalman layer are embedded in the architecture, resulting in a class of architectures with huge potential to directly learn from high variance sensor input and robustly generate low variance outcomes. The evaluation of our approach on NGSIM dataset demonstrates that SAKNN performs state-of-the-art on prediction effectiveness in a relatively long-term horizon and significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the predicted signal. 

Title: Two-Stream Networks for Lane-Change Prediction of Surrounding Vehicles
Abstract:  In highway scenarios, an alert human driver will typically anticipate early cut-in and cut-out maneuvers of surrounding vehicles using only visual cues. An automated system must anticipate these situations at an early stage too, to increase the safety and the efficiency of its performance. To deal with lane-change recognition and prediction of surrounding vehicles, we pose the problem as an action recognition/prediction problem by stacking visual cues from video cameras. Two video action recognition approaches are analyzed: two-stream convolutional networks and spatiotemporal multiplier networks. Different sizes of the regions around the vehicles are analyzed, evaluating the importance of the interaction between vehicles and the context information in the performance. In addition, different prediction horizons are evaluated. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of these methodologies to serve as robust predictors of future lane-changes of surrounding vehicles in time horizons between 1 and 2 seconds. 

Title: Learning Sparse Rewarded Tasks from Sub-Optimal Demonstrations
Abstract:  Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated its superiority on many complex sequential decision-making problems. However, heavy dependence on dense rewards and high sample-complexity impedes the wide adoption of these methods in real-world scenarios. On the other hand, imitation learning (IL) learns effectively in sparse-rewarded tasks by leveraging the existing expert demonstrations. In practice, collecting a sufficient amount of expert demonstrations can be prohibitively expensive, and the quality of demonstrations typically limits the performance of the learning policy. In this work, we propose Self-Adaptive Imitation Learning (SAIL) that can achieve (near) optimal performance given only a limited number of sub-optimal demonstrations for highly challenging sparse reward tasks. SAIL bridges the advantages of IL and RL to reduce the sample complexity substantially, by effectively exploiting sup-optimal demonstrations and efficiently exploring the environment to surpass the demonstrated performance. Extensive empirical results show that not only does SAIL significantly improve the sample-efficiency but also leads to much better final performance across different continuous control tasks, comparing to the state-of-the-art. 

Title: Learning Event-triggered Control from Data through Joint Optimization
Abstract:  We present a framework for model-free learning of event-triggered control strategies. Event-triggered methods aim to achieve high control performance while only closing the feedback loop when needed. This enables resource savings, e.g., network bandwidth if control commands are sent via communication networks, as in networked control systems. Event-triggered controllers consist of a communication policy, determining when to communicate, and a control policy, deciding what to communicate. It is essential to jointly optimize the two policies since individual optimization does not necessarily yield the overall optimal solution. To address this need for joint optimization, we propose a novel algorithm based on hierarchical reinforcement learning. The resulting algorithm is shown to accomplish high-performance control in line with resource savings and scales seamlessly to nonlinear and high-dimensional systems. The method's applicability to real-world scenarios is demonstrated through experiments on a six degrees of freedom real-time controlled manipulator. Further, we propose an approach towards evaluating the stability of the learned neural network policies. 

Title: Can User-Centered Reinforcement Learning Allow a Robot to Attract Passersby without Causing Discomfort?
Abstract:  The aim of our study was to develop a method by which a social robot can greet passersby and get their attention without causing them to suffer discomfort.A number of customer services have recently come to be provided by social robots rather than people, including, serving as receptionists, guides, and exhibitors. Robot exhibitors, for example, can explain products being promoted by the robot owners. However, a sudden greeting by a robot can startle passersby and cause discomfort to passersby.Social robots should thus adapt their mannerisms to the situation they face regarding passersby.We developed a method for meeting this requirement on the basis of the results of related work. Our proposed method, user-centered reinforcement learning, enables robots to greet passersby and get their attention without causing them to suffer discomfort (p<0.01) .The results of an experiment in the field, an office entrance, demonstrated that our method meets this requirement. 

Title: ContactGrasp: Functional Multi-finger Grasp Synthesis from Contact
Abstract:  Grasping and manipulating objects is an important human skill. Since most objects are designed to be manipulated by human hands, anthropomorphic hands can enable richer human-robot interaction. Desirable grasps are not only stable, but also functional: they enable post-grasp actions with the object. However, functional grasp synthesis for high degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic hands from object shape alone is challenging because of the large optimization space. We present ContactGrasp, a framework for functional grasp synthesis from object shape and contact on the object surface. Contact can be manually specified or obtained through demonstrations. Our contact representation is object-centric and allows functional grasp synthesis even for hand models different than the one used for demonstration. Using a dataset of contact demonstrations from humans grasping diverse household objects, we synthesize functional grasps for three hand models and two functional intents. The project webpage is https://contactdb.cc.gatech.edu/contactgrasp.html. 

Title: Choosing Smartly: Adaptive Multimodal Fusion for Object Detection in Changing Environments
Abstract:  Object detection is an essential task for autonomous robots operating in dynamic and changing environments. A robot should be able to detect objects in the presence of sensor noise that can be induced by changing lighting conditions for cameras and false depth readings for range sensors, especially RGB-D cameras. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel adaptive fusion approach for object detection that learns weighting the predictions of different sensor modalities in an online manner. Our approach is based on a mixture of convolutional neural network (CNN) experts and incorporates multiple modalities including appearance, depth and motion. We test our method in extensive robot experiments, in which we detect people in a combined indoor and outdoor scenario from RGB-D data, and we demonstrate that our method can adapt to harsh lighting changes and severe camera motion blur. Furthermore, we present a new RGB-D dataset for people detection in mixed in- and outdoor environments, recorded with a mobile robot. Code, pretrained models and dataset are available at http://adaptivefusion.cs.uni-freiburg.de 

Title: Interactive Natural Language-based Person Search
Abstract:  In this work, we consider the problem of searching people in an unconstrained environment, with natural language descriptions. Specifically, we study how to systematically design an algorithm to effectively acquire descriptions from humans. An algorithm is proposed by adapting models, used for visual and language understanding, to search a person of interest (POI) in a principled way, achieving promising results without the need to re-design another complicated model. We then investigate an iterative question-answering (QA) strategy that enable robots to request additional information about the POI's appearance from the user. To this end, we introduce a greedy algorithm to rank questions in terms of their significance, and equip the algorithm with the capability to dynamically adjust the length of human-robot interaction according to model's uncertainty. Our approach is validated not only on benchmark datasets but on a mobile robot, moving in a dynamic and crowded environment.

Title: Invariant Transform Experience Replay: Data Augmentation for Deep Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising approach for adaptive robot control, but its current application to robotics is currently hindered by high sample requirements. To alleviate this issue, we propose to exploit the symmetries present in robotic tasks. Intuitively, symmetries from observed trajectories define transformations that leave the space of feasible RL trajectories invariant and can be used to generate new feasible trajectories, which could be used for training. Based on this data augmentation idea, we formulate a general framework, called Invariant Transform Experience Replay that we present with two techniques: (i) Kaleidoscope Experience Replay exploits reflectional symmetries and (ii) Goal-augmented Experience Replay which takes advantage of lax goal definitions. In the Fetch tasks from OpenAI Gym, our experimental results show significant increases in learning rates and success rates. Particularly, we attain a 13, 3, and 5 times speedup in the pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place tasks respectively in the multi-goal setting. Performance gains are also observed in similar tasks with obstacles and we successfully deployed a trained policy on a real Baxter robot. Our work demonstrates that invariant transformations on RL trajectories are a promising methodology to speed up learning in deep RL. 

Title: 2018 Robotic Scene Segmentation Challenge
Abstract:  In 2015 we began a sub-challenge at the EndoVis workshop at MICCAI in Munich using endoscope images of ex-vivo tissue with automatically generated annotations from robot forward kinematics and instrument CAD models. However, the limited background variation and simple motion rendered the dataset uninformative in learning about which techniques would be suitable for segmentation in real surgery. In 2017, at the same workshop in Quebec we introduced the robotic instrument segmentation dataset with 10 teams participating in the challenge to perform binary, articulating parts and type segmentation of da Vinci instruments. This challenge included realistic instrument motion and more complex porcine tissue as background and was widely addressed with modifications on U-Nets and other popular CNN architectures. In 2018 we added to the complexity by introducing a set of anatomical objects and medical devices to the segmented classes. To avoid over-complicating the challenge, we continued with porcine data which is dramatically simpler than human tissue due to the lack of fatty tissue occluding many organs. 

Title: A fast, complete, point cloud based loop closure for LiDAR odometry and mapping
Abstract:  This paper presents a loop closure method to correct the long-term drift in LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM). Our proposed method computes the 2D histogram of keyframes, a local map patch, and uses the normalized cross-correlation of the 2D histograms as the similarity metric between the current keyframe and those in the map. We show that this method is fast, invariant to rotation, and produces reliable and accurate loop detection. The proposed method is implemented with careful engineering and integrated into the LOAM algorithm, forming a complete and practical system ready to use.

Title: Deep Visual Foresight for Planning Robot Motion
Abstract:  A key challenge in scaling up robot learning to many skills and environments is removing the need for human supervision, so that robots can collect their own data and improve their own performance without being limited by the cost of requesting human feedback. Model-based reinforcement learning holds the promise of enabling an agent to learn to predict the effects of its actions, which could provide flexible predictive models for a wide range of tasks and environments, without detailed human supervision. We develop a method for combining deep action-conditioned video prediction models with model-predictive control that uses entirely unlabeled training data. Our approach does not require a calibrated camera, an instrumented training set-up, nor precise sensing and actuation. Our results show that our method enables a real robot to perform nonprehensile manipulation -- pushing objects -- and can handle novel objects not seen during training. 

Title: A Minimal Closed-Form Solution for Multi-Perspective Pose Estimation using Points and Lines
Abstract:  We propose a minimal solution for pose estimation using both points and lines for a multi-perspective camera. In this paper, we treat the multi-perspective camera as a collection of rigidly attached perspective cameras. These type of imaging devices are useful for several computer vision applications that require a large coverage such as surveillance, self-driving cars, and motion-capture studios. While prior methods have considered the cases using solely points or lines, the hybrid case involving both points and lines has not been solved for multi-perspective cameras. We present the solutions for two cases. In the first case, we are given 2D to 3D correspondences for two points and one line. In the later case, we are given 2D to 3D correspondences for one point and two lines. We show that the solution for the case of two points and one line can be formulated as a fourth degree equation. This is interesting because we can get a closed-form solution and thereby achieve high computational efficiency. The later case involving two lines and one point can be mapped to an eighth degree equation. We show simulations and real experiments to demonstrate the advantages and benefits over existing methods. 

Title: The signature of robot action success in EEG signals of a human observer: Decoding and visualization using deep convolutional neural networks
Abstract:  The importance of robotic assistive devices grows in our work and everyday life. Cooperative scenarios involving both robots and humans require safe human-robot interaction. One important aspect here is the management of robot errors, including fast and accurate online robot-error detection and correction. Analysis of brain signals from a human interacting with a robot may help identifying robot errors, but accuracies of such analyses have still substantial space for improvement. In this paper we evaluate whether a novel framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) could improve the accuracy of decoding robot errors from the EEG of a human observer, both during an object grasping and a pouring task. We show that deep ConvNets reached significantly higher accuracies than both regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis (rLDA) and filter bank common spatial patterns (FB-CSP) combined with rLDA, both widely used EEG classifiers. Deep ConvNets reached mean accuracies of 75% +/- 9 %, rLDA 65% +/- 10% and FB-CSP + rLDA 63% +/- 6% for decoding of erroneous vs. correct trials. Visualization of the time-domain EEG features learned by the ConvNets to decode errors revealed spatiotemporal patterns that reflected differences between the two experimental paradigms. Across subjects, ConvNet decoding accuracies were significantly correlated with those obtained with rLDA, but not CSP, indicating that in the present context ConvNets behaved more 'rLDA-like' (but consistently better), while in a previous decoding study with another task but the same ConvNet architecture, it was found to behave more 'CSP-like'. Our findings thus provide further support for the assumption that deep ConvNets are a versatile addition to the existing toolbox of EEG decoding techniques, and we discuss steps how ConvNet EEG decoding performance could be further optimized. 

Title: Alleviating the Burden of Labeling: Sentence Generation by Attention Branch Encoder-Decoder Network
Abstract:  Domestic service robots (DSRs) are a promising solution to the shortage of home care workers. However, one of the main limitations of DSRs is their inability to interact naturally through language. Recently, data-driven approaches have been shown to be effective for tackling this limitation; however, they often require large-scale datasets, which is costly. Based on this background, we aim to perform automatic sentence generation of fetching instructions: for example, "Bring me a green tea bottle on the table." This is particularly challenging because appropriate expressions depend on the target object, as well as its surroundings. In this paper, we propose the attention branch encoder--decoder network (ABEN), to generate sentences from visual inputs. Unlike other approaches, the ABEN has multimodal attention branches that use subword-level attention and generate sentences based on subword embeddings. In experiments, we compared the ABEN with a baseline method using four standard metrics in image captioning. Results show that the ABEN outperformed the baseline in terms of these metrics. 

Title: Augmenting Differentiable Simulators with Neural Networks to Close the Sim2Real Gap
Abstract:  We present a differentiable simulation architecture for articulated rigid-body dynamics that enables the augmentation of analytical models with neural networks at any point of the computation. Through gradient-based optimization, identification of the simulation parameters and network weights is performed efficiently in preliminary experiments on a real-world dataset and in sim2sim transfer applications, while poor local optima are overcome through a random search approach. 

Title: Resolving Marker Pose Ambiguity by Robust Rotation Averaging with Clique Constraints
Abstract:  Planar markers are useful in robotics and computer vision for mapping and localisation. Given a detected marker in an image, a frequent task is to estimate the 6DOF pose of the marker relative to the camera, which is an instance of planar pose estimation (PPE). Although there are mature techniques, PPE suffers from a fundamental ambiguity problem, in that there can be more than one plausible pose solutions for a PPE instance. Especially when localisation of the marker corners is noisy, it is often difficult to disambiguate the pose solutions based on reprojection error alone. Previous methods choose between the possible solutions using a heuristic criteria, or simply ignore ambiguous markers. We propose to resolve the ambiguities by examining the consistencies of a set of markers across multiple views. Our specific contributions include a novel rotation averaging formulation that incorporates long-range dependencies between possible marker orientation solutions that arise from PPE ambiguities. We analyse the combinatorial complexity of the problem, and develop a novel lifted algorithm to effectively resolve marker pose ambiguities, without discarding any marker observations. Results on real and synthetic data show that our method is able to handle highly ambiguous inputs, and provides more accurate and/or complete marker-based mapping and localisation. 

Title: BayesRace: Learning to race autonomously using prior experience
Abstract:  Learning to race autonomously is a challenging problem. It requires perception, estimation, planning, and control to work together in synchronization while driving at the limit of a vehicle's handling capability. Among others, one of the fundamental challenges lies in predicting the vehicle's future states like position, orientation, and speed with high accuracy because it is inevitably hard to identify vehicle model parameters that capture its real nonlinear dynamics in the presence of lateral tire slip. We present a model-based planning and control framework for autonomous racing that significantly reduces the effort required in system identification. Our approach bridges the gap between the design in a simulation and the real world by learning from on-board sensor measurements. Thus, the teams participating in autonomous racing competitions can start racing on new tracks without having to worry about tuning the vehicle model. 

Title: 6-DOF Grasping for Target-driven Object Manipulation in Clutter
Abstract:  Grasping in cluttered environments is a fundamental but challenging robotic skill. It requires both reasoning about unseen object parts and potential collisions with the manipulator. Most existing data-driven approaches avoid this problem by limiting themselves to top-down planar grasps which is insufficient for many real-world scenarios and greatly limits possible grasps. We present a method that plans 6-DOF grasps for any desired object in a cluttered scene from partial point cloud observations. Our method achieves a grasp success of 80.3%, outperforming baseline approaches by 17.6% and clearing 9 cluttered table scenes (which contain 23 unknown objects and 51 picks in total) on a real robotic platform. By using our learned collision checking module, we can even reason about effective grasp sequences to retrieve objects that are not immediately accessible.

Title: Visual Affordance and Function Understanding: A Survey
Abstract:  Nowadays, robots are dominating the manufacturing, entertainment and healthcare industries. Robot vision aims to equip robots with the ability to discover information, understand it and interact with the environment. These capabilities require an agent to effectively understand object affordances and functionalities in complex visual domains. In this literature survey, we first focus on Visual affordances and summarize the state of the art as well as open problems and research gaps. Specifically, we discuss sub-problems such as affordance detection, categorization, segmentation and high-level reasoning. Furthermore, we cover functional scene understanding and the prevalent functional descriptors used in the literature. The survey also provides necessary background to the problem, sheds light on its significance and highlights the existing challenges for affordance and functionality learning. 

Title: Infrastructure-based Multi-Camera Calibration using Radial Projections
Abstract:  Multi-camera systems are an important sensor platform for intelligent systems such as self-driving cars. Pattern-based calibration techniques can be used to calibrate the intrinsics of the cameras individually. However, extrinsic calibration of systems with little to no visual overlap between the cameras is a challenge. Given the camera intrinsics, infrastucture-based calibration techniques are able to estimate the extrinsics using 3D maps pre-built via SLAM or Structure-from-Motion. In this paper, we propose to fully calibrate a multi-camera system from scratch using an infrastructure-based approach. Assuming that the distortion is mainly radial, we introduce a two-stage approach. We first estimate the camera-rig extrinsics up to a single unknown translation component per camera. Next, we solve for both the intrinsic parameters and the missing translation components. Extensive experiments on multiple indoor and outdoor scenes with multiple multi-camera systems show that our calibration method achieves high accuracy and robustness. In particular, our approach is more robust than the naive approach of first estimating intrinsic parameters and pose per camera before refining the extrinsic parameters of the system. The implementation is available at https://github.com/youkely/InfrasCal. 

Title: FLIVVER: Fly Lobula Inspired Visual Velocity Estimation & Ranging
Abstract:  The mechanism by which a tiny insect or insect-sized robot could estimate its absolute velocity and distance to nearby objects remains unknown. However, this ability is critical for behaviors that require estimating wind direction during flight, such as odor-plume tracking. Neuroscience and behavior studies with insects have shown that they rely on the perception of image motion, or optic flow, to estimate relative motion, equivalent to a ratio of their velocity and distance to objects in the world. The key open challenge is therefore to decouple these two states from a single measurement of their ratio. Although modern SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) methods provide a solution to this problem for robotic systems, these methods typically rely on computations that insects likely cannot perform, such as simultaneously tracking multiple individual visual features, remembering a 3D map of the world, and solving nonlinear optimization problems using iterative algorithms. Here we present a novel algorithm, FLIVVER, which combines the geometry of dynamic forward motion with inspiration from insect visual processing to \textit{directly} estimate absolute ground velocity from a combination of optic flow and acceleration information. Our algorithm provides a clear hypothesis for how insects might estimate absolute velocity, and also provides a theoretical framework for designing fast analog circuitry for efficient state estimation, which could be applied to insect-sized robots. 

Title: kPAM-SC: Generalizable Manipulation Planning using KeyPoint Affordance and Shape Completion
Abstract:  Manipulation planning is the task of computing robot trajectories that move a set of objects to their target configuration while satisfying physically feasibility. In contrast to existing works that assume known object templates, we are interested in manipulation planning for a category of objects with potentially unknown instances and large intra-category shape variation. To achieve it, we need an object representation with which the manipulation planner can reason about both the physical feasibility and desired object configuration, while being generalizable to novel instances. The widely-used pose representation is not suitable, as representing an object with a parameterized transformation from a fixed template cannot capture large intra-category shape variation. Hence, we propose a new hybrid object representation consisting of semantic keypoint and dense geometry (a point cloud or mesh) as the interface between the perception module and motion planner. Leveraging advances in learning-based keypoint detection and shape completion, both dense geometry and keypoints can be perceived from raw sensor input. Using the proposed hybrid object representation, we formulate the manipulation task as a motion planning problem which encodes both the object target configuration and physical feasibility for a category of objects. In this way, many existing manipulation planners can be generalized to categories of objects, and the resulting perception-to-action manipulation pipeline is robust to large intra-category shape variation. Extensive hardware experiments demonstrate our pipeline can produce robot trajectories that accomplish tasks with never-before-seen objects. 

Title: SHOP-VRB: A Visual Reasoning Benchmark for Object Perception
Abstract:  In this paper we present an approach and a benchmark for visual reasoning in robotics applications, in particular small object grasping and manipulation. The approach and benchmark are focused on inferring object properties from visual and text data. It concerns small household objects with their properties, functionality, natural language descriptions as well as question-answer pairs for visual reasoning queries along with their corresponding scene semantic representations. We also present a method for generating synthetic data which allows to extend the benchmark to other objects or scenes and propose an evaluation protocol that is more challenging than in the existing datasets. We propose a reasoning system based on symbolic program execution. A disentangled representation of the visual and textual inputs is obtained and used to execute symbolic programs that represent a 'reasoning process' of the algorithm. We perform a set of experiments on the proposed benchmark and compare to results for the state of the art methods. These results expose the shortcomings of the existing benchmarks that may lead to misleading conclusions on the actual performance of the visual reasoning systems. 

Title: Real-Time RGB-D based Template Matching Pedestrian Detection
Abstract:  Pedestrian detection is one of the most popular topics in computer vision and robotics. Considering challenging issues in multiple pedestrian detection, we present a real-time depth-based template matching people detector. In this paper, we propose different approaches for training the depth-based template. We train multiple templates for handling issues due to various upper-body orientations of the pedestrians and different levels of detail in depth-map of the pedestrians with various distances from the camera. And, we take into account the degree of reliability for different regions of sliding window by proposing the weighted template approach. Furthermore, we combine the depth-detector with an appearance based detector as a verifier to take advantage of the appearance cues for dealing with the limitations of depth data. We evaluate our method on the challenging ETH dataset sequence. We show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. 

Title: Sparse2Dense: From direct sparse odometry to dense 3D reconstruction
Abstract:  In this paper, we proposed a new deep learning based dense monocular SLAM method. Compared to existing methods, the proposed framework constructs a dense 3D model via a sparse to dense mapping using learned surface normals. With single view learned depth estimation as prior for monocular visual odometry, we obtain both accurate positioning and high quality depth reconstruction. The depth and normal are predicted by a single network trained in a tightly coupled manner.Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the performance of visual tracking and depth prediction in comparison to the state-of-the-art in deep monocular dense SLAM. 

Title: 3DOF Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Learned from Long-Term Autonomous Mobile Robot Deployment Data
Abstract:  This paper presents a novel 3DOF pedestrian trajectory prediction approach for autonomous mobile service robots. While most previously reported methods are based on learning of 2D positions in monocular camera images, our approach uses range-finder sensors to learn and predict 3DOF pose trajectories (i.e. 2D position plus 1D rotation within the world coordinate system). Our approach, T-Pose-LSTM (Temporal 3DOF-Pose Long-Short-Term Memory), is trained using long-term data from real-world robot deployments and aims to learn context-dependent (environment- and time-specific) human activities. Our approach incorporates long-term temporal information (i.e. date and time) with short-term pose observations as input. A sequence-to-sequence LSTM encoder-decoder is trained, which encodes observations into LSTM and then decodes as predictions. For deployment, it can perform on-the-fly prediction in real-time. Instead of using manually annotated data, we rely on a robust human detection, tracking and SLAM system, providing us with examples in a global coordinate system. We validate the approach using more than 15K pedestrian trajectories recorded in a care home environment over a period of three months. The experiment shows that the proposed T-Pose-LSTM model advances the state-of-the-art 2D-based method for human trajectory prediction in long-term mobile robot deployments. 

Title: Balancing a CartPole System with Reinforcement Learning -- A Tutorial
Abstract:  In this paper, we provide the details of implementing various reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for controlling a Cart-Pole system. In particular, we describe various RL concepts such as Q-learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN), Double DQN, Dueling networks, (prioritized) experience replay and show their effect on the learning performance. In the process, the readers will be introduced to OpenAI/Gym and Keras utilities used for implementing the above concepts. It is observed that DQN with PER provides best performance among all other architectures being able to solve the problem within 150 episodes. 

Title: Vision-based Navigation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to a variety of game-like environments. However, the application of deep RL to visual navigation with realistic environments is a challenging task. We propose a novel learning architecture capable of navigating an agent, e.g. a mobile robot, to a target given by an image. To achieve this, we have extended the batched A2C algorithm with auxiliary tasks designed to improve visual navigation performance. We propose three additional auxiliary tasks: predicting the segmentation of the observation image and of the target image and predicting the depth-map. These tasks enable the use of supervised learning to pre-train a large part of the network and to reduce the number of training steps substantially. The training performance has been further improved by increasing the environment complexity gradually over time. An efficient neural network structure is proposed, which is capable of learning for multiple targets in multiple environments. Our method navigates in continuous state spaces and on the AI2-THOR environment simulator outperforms state-of-the-art goal-oriented visual navigation methods from the literature. 

Title: Pan-Tilt Camera and PIR Sensor Fusion Based Moving Object Detection for Mobile Security Robots
Abstract:  One of fundamental issues for security robots is to detect and track people in the surroundings. The main problems of this task are real-time constraints, a changing background, varying illumination conditions and a non-rigid shape of the person to be tracked. In this paper, we propose a solution for tracking with a pan-tilt camera and a passive infrared range (PIR) sensor to detect the moving object based on consecutive frame difference. The proposed method is excellent in real-time performance because it requires only a little memory and computation. Experiment results show that this method can detect the moving object such as human efficiently and accurately in non-stationary and complex indoor environment. 

Title: ABC-LMPC: Safe Sample-Based Learning MPC for Stochastic Nonlinear Dynamical Systems with Adjustable Boundary Conditions
Abstract:  Sample-based learning model predictive control (LMPC) strategies have recently attracted attention due to their desirable theoretical properties and their good empirical performance on robotic tasks. However, prior analysis of LMPC controllers for stochastic systems has mainly focused on linear systems in the iterative learning control setting. We present a novel LMPC algorithm, Adjustable Boundary Condition LMPC (ABC-LMPC), which enables rapid adaptation to novel start and goal configurations and theoretically show that the resulting controller guarantees iterative improvement in expectation for stochastic nonlinear systems. We present results with a practical instantiation of this algorithm and experimentally demonstrate that the resulting controller adapts to a variety of initial and terminal conditions on 3 stochastic continuous control tasks. 

Title: Robust Visual SLAM with Point and Line Features
Abstract:  In this paper, we develop a robust efficient visual SLAM system that utilizes heterogeneous point and line features. By leveraging ORB-SLAM [1], the proposed system consists of stereo matching, frame tracking, local mapping, loop detection, and bundle adjustment of both point and line features. In particular, as the main theoretical contributions of this paper, we, for the first time, employ the orthonormal representation as the minimal parameterization to model line features along with point features in visual SLAM and analytically derive the Jacobians of the re-projection errors with respect to the line parameters, which significantly improves the SLAM solution. The proposed SLAM has been extensively tested in both synthetic and real-world experiments whose results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in various scenarios. 

Title: Semi-Global Stereo Matching with Surface Orientation Priors
Abstract:  Semi-Global Matching (SGM) is a widely-used efficient stereo matching technique. It works well for textured scenes, but fails on untextured slanted surfaces due to its fronto-parallel smoothness assumption. To remedy this problem, we propose a simple extension, termed SGM-P, to utilize precomputed surface orientation priors. Such priors favor different surface slants in different 2D image regions or 3D scene regions and can be derived in various ways. In this paper we evaluate plane orientation priors derived from stereo matching at a coarser resolution and show that such priors can yield significant performance gains for difficult weakly-textured scenes. We also explore surface normal priors derived from Manhattan-world assumptions, and we analyze the potential performance gains using oracle priors derived from ground-truth data. SGM-P only adds a minor computational overhead to SGM and is an attractive alternative to more complex methods employing higher-order smoothness terms. 

Title: Dynamic Reconfiguration of Mission Parameters in Underwater Human-Robot Collaboration
Abstract:  This paper presents a real-time programming and parameter reconfiguration method for autonomous underwater robots in human-robot collaborative tasks. Using a set of intuitive and meaningful hand gestures, we develop a syntactically simple framework that is computationally more efficient than a complex, grammar-based approach. In the proposed framework, a convolutional neural network is trained to provide accurate hand gesture recognition; subsequently, a finite-state machine-based deterministic model performs efficient gesture-to-instruction mapping, and further improves robustness of the interaction scheme. The key aspect of this framework is that it can be easily adopted by divers for communicating simple instructions to underwater robots without using artificial tags such as fiducial markers, or requiring them to memorize a potentially complex set of language rules. Extensive experiments are performed both on field-trial data and through simulation, which demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and portability of this framework in a number of different scenarios. Finally, a user interaction study is presented that illustrates the gain in usability of our proposed interaction framework compared to the existing methods for underwater domains. 

Title: Neural Ray Surfaces for Self-Supervised Learning of Depth and Ego-motion
Abstract:  Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for depth and ego-motion estimation, leading to state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. However, one significant limitation shared by current methods is the assumption of a known parametric camera model -- usually the standard pinhole geometry -- leading to failure when applied to imaging systems that deviate significantly from this assumption (e.g., catadioptric cameras or underwater imaging). In this work, we show that self-supervision can be used to learn accurate depth and ego-motion estimation without prior knowledge of the camera model. Inspired by the geometric model of Grossberg and Nayar, we introduce Neural Ray Surfaces (NRS), convolutional networks that represent pixel-wise projection rays, approximating a wide range of cameras. NRS are fully differentiable and can be learned end-to-end from unlabeled raw videos. We demonstrate the use of NRS for self-supervised learning of visual odometry and depth estimation from raw videos obtained using a wide variety of camera systems, including pinhole, fisheye, and catadioptric. 

Title: Intrinsic Motivation and Episodic Memories for Robot Exploration of High-Dimensional Sensory Spaces
Abstract:  This work presents an architecture that generates curiosity-driven goal-directed exploration behaviours for an image sensor of a microfarming robot. A combination of deep neural networks for offline unsupervised learning of low-dimensional features from images, and of online learning of shallow neural networks representing the inverse and forward kinematics of the system have been used. The artificial curiosity system assigns interest values to a set of pre-defined goals, and drives the exploration towards those that are expected to maximise the learning progress. We propose the integration of an episodic memory in intrinsic motivation systems to face catastrophic forgetting issues, typically experienced when performing online updates of artificial neural networks. Our results show that adopting an episodic memory system not only prevents the computational models from quickly forgetting knowledge that has been previously acquired, but also provides new avenues for modulating the balance between plasticity and stability of the models. 

Title: Attention-Guided Lightweight Network for Real-Time Segmentation of Robotic Surgical Instruments
Abstract:  The real-time segmentation of surgical instruments plays a crucial role in robot-assisted surgery. However, it is still a challenging task to implement deep learning models to do real-time segmentation for surgical instruments due to their high computational costs and slow inference speed. In this paper, we propose an attention-guided lightweight network (LWANet), which can segment surgical instruments in real-time. LWANet adopts encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder is the lightweight network MobileNetV2, and the decoder consists of depthwise separable convolution, attention fusion block, and transposed convolution. Depthwise separable convolution is used as the basic unit to construct the decoder, which can reduce the model size and computational costs. Attention fusion block captures global contexts and encodes semantic dependencies between channels to emphasize target regions, contributing to locating the surgical instrument. Transposed convolution is performed to upsample feature maps for acquiring refined edges. LWANet can segment surgical instruments in real-time while takes little computational costs. Based on 960*544 inputs, its inference speed can reach 39 fps with only 3.39 GFLOPs. Also, it has a small model size and the number of parameters is only 2.06 M. The proposed network is evaluated on two datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art performance 94.10% mean IOU on Cata7 and obtains a new record on EndoVis 2017 with a 4.10% increase on mean IOU. 

Title: A Data-Efficient Framework for Training and Sim-to-Real Transfer of Navigation Policies
Abstract:  Learning effective visuomotor policies for robots purely from data is challenging, but also appealing since a learning-based system should not require manual tuning or calibration. In the case of a robot operating in a real environment the training process can be costly, time-consuming, and even dangerous since failures are common at the start of training. For this reason, it is desirable to be able to leverage \textit{simulation} and \textit{off-policy} data to the extent possible to train the robot. In this work, we introduce a robust framework that plans in simulation and transfers well to the real environment. Our model incorporates a gradient-descent based planning module, which, given the initial image and goal image, encodes the images to a lower dimensional latent state and plans a trajectory to reach the goal. The model, consisting of the encoder and planner modules, is trained through a meta-learning strategy in simulation first. We subsequently perform adversarial domain transfer on the encoder by using a bank of unlabelled but random images from the simulation and real environments to enable the encoder to map images from the real and simulated environments to a similarly distributed latent representation. By fine tuning the entire model (encoder + planner) with far fewer real world expert demonstrations, we show successful planning performances in different navigation tasks. 

Title: Robust Unsupervised Learning of Temporal Dynamic Interactions
Abstract:  Robust representation learning of temporal dynamic interactions is an important problem in robotic learning in general and automated unsupervised learning in particular. Temporal dynamic interactions can be described by (multiple) geometric trajectories in a suitable space over which unsupervised learning techniques may be applied to extract useful features from raw and high-dimensional data measurements. Taking a geometric approach to robust representation learning for temporal dynamic interactions, it is necessary to develop suitable metrics and a systematic methodology for comparison and for assessing the stability of an unsupervised learning method with respect to its tuning parameters. Such metrics must account for the (geometric) constraints in the physical world as well as the uncertainty associated with the learned patterns. In this paper we introduce a model-free metric based on the Procrustes distance for robust representation learning of interactions, and an optimal transport based distance metric for comparing between distributions of interaction primitives. These distance metrics can serve as an objective for assessing the stability of an interaction learning algorithm. They are also used for comparing the outcomes produced by different algorithms. Moreover, they may also be adopted as an objective function to obtain clusters and representative interaction primitives. These concepts and techniques will be introduced, along with mathematical properties, while their usefulness will be demonstrated in unsupervised learning of vehicle-to-vechicle interactions extracted from the Safety Pilot database, the world's largest database for connected vehicles. 

Title: UrbanLoco: A Full Sensor Suite Dataset for Mapping and Localization in Urban Scenes
Abstract:  Mapping and localization is a critical module of autonomous driving, and significant achievements have been reached in this field. Beyond Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), research in point cloud registration, visual feature matching, and inertia navigation has greatly enhanced the accuracy and robustness of mapping and localization in different scenarios. However, highly urbanized scenes are still challenging: LIDAR- and camera-based methods perform poorly with numerous dynamic objects; the GNSS-based solutions experience signal loss and multipath problems; the inertia measurement units (IMU) suffer from drifting. Unfortunately, current public datasets either do not adequately address this urban challenge or do not provide enough sensor information related to mapping and localization. Here we present UrbanLoco: a mapping/localization dataset collected in highly-urbanized environments with a full sensor-suite. The dataset includes 13 trajectories collected in San Francisco and Hong Kong, covering a total length of over 40 kilometers. Our dataset includes a wide variety of urban terrains: urban canyons, bridges, tunnels, sharp turns, etc. More importantly, our dataset includes information from LIDAR, cameras, IMU, and GNSS receivers. Now the dataset is publicly available through the link in the footnote. Dataset Link: https://advdataset2019.wixsite.com/urbanloco. 

Title: Multi-agent Motion Planning for Dense and Dynamic Environments via Deep Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:  This paper introduces a hybrid algorithm of deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Force-based motion planning (FMP) to solve distributed motion planning problem in dense and dynamic environments. Individually, RL and FMP algorithms each have their own limitations. FMP is not able to produce time-optimal paths and existing RL solutions are not able to produce collision-free paths in dense environments. Therefore, we first tried improving the performance of recent RL approaches by introducing a new reward function that not only eliminates the requirement of a pre supervised learning (SL) step but also decreases the chance of collision in crowded environments. That improved things, but there were still a lot of failure cases. So, we developed a hybrid approach to leverage the simpler FMP approach in stuck, simple and high-risk cases, and continue using RL for normal cases in which FMP can't produce optimal path. Also, we extend GA3C-CADRL algorithm to 3D environment. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms both deep RL and FMP algorithms and produces up to 50% more successful scenarios than deep RL and up to 75% less extra time to reach goal than FMP. 

Title: Learning Navigation Costs from Demonstration with Semantic Observations
Abstract:  This paper focuses on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) for autonomous robot navigation using semantic observations. The objective is to infer a cost function that explains demonstrated behavior while relying only on the expert's observations and state-control trajectory. We develop a map encoder, which infers semantic class probabilities from the observation sequence, and a cost encoder, defined as deep neural network over the semantic features. Since the expert cost is not directly observable, the representation parameters can only be optimized by differentiating the error between demonstrated controls and a control policy computed from the cost estimate. The error is optimized using a closed-form subgradient computed only over a subset of promising states via a motion planning algorithm. We show that our approach learns to follow traffic rules in the autonomous driving CARLA simulator by relying on semantic observations of cars, sidewalks and road lanes. 

Title: Multi-Task Recurrent Neural Network for Surgical Gesture Recognition and Progress Prediction
Abstract:  Surgical gesture recognition is important for surgical data science and computer-aided intervention. Even with robotic kinematic information, automatically segmenting surgical steps presents numerous challenges because surgical demonstrations are characterized by high variability in style, duration and order of actions. In order to extract discriminative features from the kinematic signals and boost recognition accuracy, we propose a multi-task recurrent neural network for simultaneous recognition of surgical gestures and estimation of a novel formulation of surgical task progress. To show the effectiveness of the presented approach, we evaluate its application on the JIGSAWS dataset, that is currently the only publicly available dataset for surgical gesture recognition featuring robot kinematic data. We demonstrate that recognition performance improves in multi-task frameworks with progress estimation without any additional manual labelling and training. 

Title: Scaling data-driven robotics with reward sketching and batch reinforcement learning
Abstract:  We present a framework for data-driven robotics that makes use of a large dataset of recorded robot experience and scales to several tasks using learned reward functions. We show how to apply this framework to accomplish three different object manipulation tasks on a real robot platform. Given demonstrations of a task together with task-agnostic recorded experience, we use a special form of human annotation as supervision to learn a reward function, which enables us to deal with real-world tasks where the reward signal cannot be acquired directly. Learned rewards are used in combination with a large dataset of experience from different tasks to learn a robot policy offline using batch RL. We show that using our approach it is possible to train agents to perform a variety of challenging manipulation tasks including stacking rigid objects and handling cloth. 

Title: Extracting Contact and Motion from Manipulation Videos
Abstract:  When we physically interact with our environment using our hands, we touch objects and force them to move: contact and motion are defining properties of manipulation. In this paper, we present an active, bottom-up method for the detection of actor-object contacts and the extraction of moved objects and their motions in RGBD videos of manipulation actions. At the core of our approach lies non-rigid registration: we continuously warp a point cloud model of the observed scene to the current video frame, generating a set of dense 3D point trajectories. Under loose assumptions, we employ simple point cloud segmentation techniques to extract the actor and subsequently detect actor-environment contacts based on the estimated trajectories. For each such interaction, using the detected contact as an attention mechanism, we obtain an initial motion segment for the manipulated object by clustering trajectories in the contact area vicinity and then we jointly refine the object segment and estimate its 6DOF pose in all observed frames. Because of its generality and the fundamental, yet highly informative, nature of its outputs, our approach is applicable to a wide range of perception and planning tasks. We qualitatively evaluate our method on a number of input sequences and present a comprehensive robot imitation learning example, in which we demonstrate the crucial role of our outputs in developing action representations/plans from observation. 

Title: Field geology with a wearable computer: 1st results of the Cyborg Astrobiologist System
Abstract:  We present results from the first geological field tests of the `Cyborg Astrobiologist', which is a wearable computer and video camcorder system that we are using to test and train a computer-vision system towards having some of the autonomous decision-making capabilities of a field-geologist. The Cyborg Astrobiologist platform has thus far been used for testing and development of these algorithms and systems: robotic acquisition of quasi-mosaics of images, real-time image segmentation, and real-time determination of interesting points in the image mosaics. This work is more of a test of the whole system, rather than of any one part of the system. However, beyond the concept of the system itself, the uncommon map (despite its simplicity) is the main innovative part of the system. The uncommon map helps to determine interest-points in a context-free manner. Overall, the hardware and software systems function reliably, and the computer-vision algorithms are adequate for the first field tests. In addition to the proof-of-concept aspect of these field tests, the main result of these field tests is the enumeration of those issues that we can improve in the future, including: dealing with structural shadow and microtexture, and also, controlling the camera's zoom lens in an intelligent manner. Nonetheless, despite these and other technical inadequacies, this Cyborg Astrobiologist system, consisting of a camera-equipped wearable-computer and its computer-vision algorithms, has demonstrated its ability of finding genuinely interesting points in real-time in the geological scenery, and then gathering more information about these interest points in an automated manner. We use these capabilities for autonomous guidance towards geological points-of-interest. 

Title: ClickBAIT-v2: Training an Object Detector in Real-Time
Abstract:  Modern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and object detection are often trained offline on large static datasets. Some applications, however, will require training in real-time on live video streams with a human-in-the-loop. We refer to this class of problem as time-ordered online training (ToOT). These problems will require a consideration of not only the quantity of incoming training data, but the human effort required to annotate and use it. We demonstrate and evaluate a system tailored to training an object detector on a live video stream with minimal input from a human operator. We show that we can obtain bounding box annotation from weakly-supervised single-point clicks through interactive segmentation. Furthermore, by exploiting the time-ordered nature of the video stream through object tracking, we can increase the average training benefit of human interactions by 3-4 times. 

Title: Asynchronous Multi Agent Active Search
Abstract:  Active search refers to the problem of efficiently locating targets in an unknown environment by actively making data-collection decisions, and has many applications including detecting gas leaks, radiation sources or human survivors of disasters using aerial and/or ground robots (agents). Existing active search methods are in general only amenable to a single agent, or if they extend to multi agent they require a central control system to coordinate the actions of all agents. However, such control systems are often impractical in robotics applications. In this paper, we propose two distinct active search algorithms called SPATS (Sparse Parallel Asynchronous Thompson Sampling) and LATSI (LAplace Thompson Sampling with Information gain) that allow for multiple agents to independently make data-collection decisions without a central coordinator. Throughout we consider that targets are sparsely located around the environment in keeping with compressive sensing assumptions and its applicability in real world scenarios. Additionally, while most common search algorithms assume that agents can sense the entire environment (e.g. compressive sensing) or sense point-wise (e.g. Bayesian Optimization) at all times, we make a realistic assumption that each agent can only sense a contiguous region of space at a time. We provide simulation results as well as theoretical analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms. 

Title: Ground Texture Based Localization Using Compact Binary Descriptors
Abstract:  Ground texture based localization is a promising approach to achieve high-accuracy positioning of vehicles. We present a self-contained method that can be used for global localization as well as for subsequent local localization updates, i.e. it allows a robot to localize without any knowledge of its current whereabouts, but it can also take advantage of a prior pose estimate to reduce computation time significantly. Our method is based on a novel matching strategy, which we call identity matching, that is based on compact binary feature descriptors. Identity matching treats pairs of features as matches only if their descriptors are identical. While other methods for global localization are faster to compute, our method reaches higher localization success rates, and can switch to local localization after the initial localization. 

Title: Active Preference-Based Gaussian Process Regression for Reward Learning
Abstract:  Designing reward functions is a challenging problem in AI and robotics. Humans usually have a difficult time directly specifying all the desirable behaviors that a robot needs to optimize. One common approach is to learn reward functions from collected expert demonstrations. However, learning reward functions from demonstrations introduces many challenges: some methods require highly structured models, e.g. reward functions that are linear in some predefined set of features, while others adopt less structured reward functions that on the other hand require tremendous amount of data. In addition, humans tend to have a difficult time providing demonstrations on robots with high degrees of freedom, or even quantifying reward values for given demonstrations. To address these challenges, we present a preference-based learning approach, where as an alternative, the human feedback is only in the form of comparisons between trajectories. Furthermore, we do not assume highly constrained structures on the reward function. Instead, we model the reward function using a Gaussian Process (GP) and propose a mathematical formulation to actively find a GP using only human preferences. Our approach enables us to tackle both inflexibility and data-inefficiency problems within a preference-based learning framework. Our results in simulations and a user study suggest that our approach can efficiently learn expressive reward functions for robotics tasks. 

Title: Learning to Singulate Objects using a Push Proposal Network
Abstract:  Learning to act in unstructured environments, such as cluttered piles of objects, poses a substantial challenge for manipulation robots. We present a novel neural network-based approach that separates unknown objects in clutter by selecting favourable push actions. Our network is trained from data collected through autonomous interaction of a PR2 robot with randomly organized tabletop scenes. The model is designed to propose meaningful push actions based on over-segmented RGB-D images. We evaluate our approach by singulating up to 8 unknown objects in clutter. We demonstrate that our method enables the robot to perform the task with a high success rate and a low number of required push actions. Our results based on real-world experiments show that our network is able to generalize to novel objects of various sizes and shapes, as well as to arbitrary object configurations. Videos of our experiments can be viewed at http://robotpush.cs.uni-freiburg.de 

Title: Fast Disparity Estimation using Dense Networks
Abstract:  Disparity estimation is a difficult problem in stereo vision because the correspondence technique fails in images with textureless and repetitive regions. Recent body of work using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) overcomes this problem with semantics. Most CNN implementations use an autoencoder method; stereo images are encoded, merged and finally decoded to predict the disparity map. In this paper, we present a CNN implementation inspired by dense networks to reduce the number of parameters. Furthermore, our approach takes into account semantic reasoning in disparity estimation. Our proposed network, called DenseMapNet, is compact, fast and can be trained end-to-end. DenseMapNet requires 290k parameters only and runs at 30Hz or faster on color stereo images in full resolution. Experimental results show that DenseMapNet accuracy is comparable with other significantly bigger CNN-based methods. 

Title: V2CNet: A Deep Learning Framework to Translate Videos to Commands for Robotic Manipulation
Abstract:  We propose V2CNet, a new deep learning framework to automatically translate the demonstration videos to commands that can be directly used in robotic applications. Our V2CNet has two branches and aims at understanding the demonstration video in a fine-grained manner. The first branch has the encoder-decoder architecture to encode the visual features and sequentially generate the output words as a command, while the second branch uses a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to learn the fine-grained actions. By jointly training both branches, the network is able to model the sequential information of the command, while effectively encodes the fine-grained actions. The experimental results on our new large-scale dataset show that V2CNet outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin, while its output can be applied in real robotic applications. The source code and trained models will be made available. 

Title: Rules of the Road: Predicting Driving Behavior with a Convolutional Model of Semantic Interactions
Abstract:  We focus on the problem of predicting future states of entities in complex, real-world driving scenarios. Previous research has used low-level signals to predict short time horizons, and has not addressed how to leverage key assets relied upon heavily by industry self-driving systems: (1) large 3D perception efforts which provide highly accurate 3D states of agents with rich attributes, and (2) detailed and accurate semantic maps of the environment (lanes, traffic lights, crosswalks, etc). We present a unified representation which encodes such high-level semantic information in a spatial grid, allowing the use of deep convolutional models to fuse complex scene context. This enables learning entity-entity and entity-environment interactions with simple, feed-forward computations in each timestep within an overall temporal model of an agent's behavior. We propose different ways of modelling the future as a distribution over future states using standard supervised learning. We introduce a novel dataset providing industry-grade rich perception and semantic inputs, and empirically show we can effectively learn fundamentals of driving behavior. 

Title: Fully Convolutional Grasp Detection Network with Oriented Anchor Box
Abstract:  In this paper, we present a real-time approach to predict multiple grasping poses for a parallel-plate robotic gripper using RGB images. A model with oriented anchor box mechanism is proposed and a new matching strategy is used during the training process. An end-to-end fully convolutional neural network is employed in our work. The network consists of two parts: the feature extractor and multi-grasp predictor. The feature extractor is a deep convolutional neural network. The multi-grasp predictor regresses grasp rectangles from predefined oriented rectangles, called oriented anchor boxes, and classifies the rectangles into graspable and ungraspable. On the standard Cornell Grasp Dataset, our model achieves an accuracy of 97.74% and 96.61% on image-wise split and object-wise split respectively, and outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approach by 1.74% on image-wise split and 0.51% on object-wise split. 

Title: Hierarchical Kinematic Human Mesh Recovery
Abstract:  We consider the problem of estimating a parametric model of 3D human mesh from a single image. While there has been substantial recent progress in this area with direct regression of model parameters, these methods only implicitly exploit the human body kinematic structure, leading to sub-optimal use of the model prior. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a new technique for regression of human parametric model that is explicitly informed by the known hierarchical structure, including joint interdependencies of the model. This results in a strong prior-informed design of the regressor architecture and an associated hierarchical optimization that is flexible to be used in conjunction with the current standard frameworks for 3D human mesh recovery. We demonstrate these aspects by means of extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, showing how our proposed new design outperforms several existing and popular methods, establishing new state-of-the-art results. By considering joint interdependencies, our method is equipped to infer joints even under data corruptions, which we demonstrate by conducting experiments under varying degrees of occlusion. 

Title: Not Only Look But Observe: Variational Observation Model of Scene-Level 3D Multi-Object Understanding for Probabilistic SLAM
Abstract:  We present NOLBO, a variational observation model estimation for 3D multi-object from 2D single shot. Previous probabilistic instance-level understandings mainly consider the single-object image, not single shot with multi-object; relations between objects and the entire scene are out of their focus. The objectness of each observation also hardly join their model. Therefore, we propose a method to approximate the Bayesian observation model of scene-level 3D multi-object understanding. By exploiting variational auto-encoder (VAE), we estimate latent variables from the entire scene, which follow tractable distributions and concurrently imply 3D full shape and pose. To perform object-oriented data association and probabilistic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), our observation models can easily be adopted to probabilistic inference by replacing object-oriented features with latent variables. 

Title: SegICP: Integrated Deep Semantic Segmentation and Pose Estimation
Abstract:  Recent robotic manipulation competitions have highlighted that sophisticated robots still struggle to achieve fast and reliable perception of task-relevant objects in complex, realistic scenarios. To improve these systems' perceptive speed and robustness, we present SegICP, a novel integrated solution to object recognition and pose estimation. SegICP couples convolutional neural networks and multi-hypothesis point cloud registration to achieve both robust pixel-wise semantic segmentation as well as accurate and real-time 6-DOF pose estimation for relevant objects. Our architecture achieves 1cm position error and <5^\circ$ angle error in real time without an initial seed. We evaluate and benchmark SegICP against an annotated dataset generated by motion capture. 

Title: Spatial Priming for Detecting Human-Object Interactions
Abstract:  The relative spatial layout of a human and an object is an important cue for determining how they interact. However, until now, spatial layout has been used just as side-information for detecting human-object interactions (HOIs). In this paper, we present a method for exploiting this spatial layout information for detecting HOIs in images. The proposed method consists of a layout module which primes a visual module to predict the type of interaction between a human and an object. The visual and layout modules share information through lateral connections at several stages. The model uses predictions from the layout module as a prior to the visual module and the prediction from the visual module is given as the final output. It also incorporates semantic information about the object using word2vec vectors. The proposed model reaches an mAP of 24.79% for HICO-Det dataset which is about 2.8% absolute points higher than the current state-of-the-art. 

Title: Action-conditioned Benchmarking of Robotic Video Prediction Models: a Comparative Study
Abstract:  A defining characteristic of intelligent systems is the ability to make action decisions based on the anticipated outcomes. Video prediction systems have been demonstrated as a solution for predicting how the future will unfold visually, and thus, many models have been proposed that are capable of predicting future frames based on a history of observed frames~(and sometimes robot actions). However, a comprehensive method for determining the fitness of different video prediction models at guiding the selection of actions is yet to be developed. Current metrics assess video prediction models based on human perception of frame quality. In contrast, we argue that if these systems are to be used to guide action, necessarily, the actions the robot performs should be encoded in the predicted frames. In this paper, we are proposing a new metric to compare different video prediction models based on this argument. More specifically, we propose an action inference system and quantitatively rank different models based on how well we can infer the robot actions from the predicted frames. Our extensive experiments show that models with high perceptual scores can perform poorly in the proposed action inference tests and thus, may not be suitable options to be used in robot planning systems. 

Title: Memory-based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Obstacle Avoidance in UAV with Limited Environment Knowledge
Abstract:  This paper presents our method for enabling a UAV quadrotor, equipped with a monocular camera, to autonomously avoid collisions with obstacles in unstructured and unknown indoor environments. When compared to obstacle avoidance in ground vehicular robots, UAV navigation brings in additional challenges because the UAV motion is no more constrained to a well-defined indoor ground or street environment. Horizontal structures in indoor and outdoor environments like decorative items, furnishings, ceiling fans, sign-boards, tree branches etc., also become relevant obstacles unlike those for ground vehicular robots. Thus, methods of obstacle avoidance developed for ground robots are clearly inadequate for UAV navigation. Current control methods using monocular images for UAV obstacle avoidance are heavily dependent on environment information. These controllers do not fully retain and utilize the extensively available information about the ambient environment for decision making. We propose a deep reinforcement learning based method for UAV obstacle avoidance (OA) and autonomous exploration which is capable of doing exactly the same. The crucial idea in our method is the concept of partial observability and how UAVs can retain relevant information about the environment structure to make better future navigation decisions. Our OA technique uses recurrent neural networks with temporal attention and provides better results compared to prior works in terms of distance covered during navigation without collisions. In addition, our technique has a high inference rate (a key factor in robotic applications) and is energy-efficient as it minimizes oscillatory motion of UAV and reduces power wastage. 

Title: From perception to control: an autonomous driving system for a formula student driverless car
Abstract:  This paper introduces the autonomous system of the "Smart Shark II" which won the Formula Student Autonomous China (FSAC) Competition in 2018. In this competition, an autonomous racecar is required to complete autonomously two laps of unknown track. In this paper, the author presents the self-driving software structure of this racecar which ensure high vehicle speed and safety. The key components ensure a stable driving of the racecar, LiDAR-based and Vision-based cone detection provide a redundant perception; the EKF-based localization offers high accuracy and high frequency state estimation; perception results are accumulated in time and space by occupancy grid map. After getting the trajectory, a model predictive control algorithm is used to optimize in both longitudinal and lateral control of the racecar. Finally, the performance of an experiment based on real-world data is shown. 

Title: Depth Camera Based Particle Filter for Robotic Osteotomy Navigation
Abstract:  Active surgical robots lack acceptance in clinical practice, because they do not offer the flexibility and usability required for a versatile usage: the systems require a large installation space or a complicated registration step, where the preoperative plan is aligned to the patient and transformed to the base frame of the robot. In this paper, a navigation system for robotic osteotomies is designed, which uses the raw depth images from a camera mounted on the flange of a lightweight robot arm. Consequently, the system does not require any rigid attachment of the robot or fiducials to the bone and the time-consuming registration step is eliminated. Instead, only a coarse initialization is required which improves the usability in surgery. The full six dimensional pose of the iliac crest bone is estimated with a particle filter at a maximum rate of 90 Hz. The presented method is robust against changing lighting conditions, blood or tissue on the bone surface and partial occlusions caused by the surgeons. Proof of the usability in a clinical environment is successfully provided in a corpse study, where surgeons used an augmented reality osteotomy template, which was aligned to bone via the particle filters pose estimates for the resection of transplants from the iliac crest. 

Title: Gradient-based Camera Exposure Control for Outdoor Mobile Platforms
Abstract:  We introduce a novel method to automatically adjust camera exposure for image processing and computer vision applications on mobile robot platforms. Because most image processing algorithms rely heavily on low-level image features that are based mainly on local gradient information, we consider that gradient quantity can determine the proper exposure level, allowing a camera to capture the important image features in a manner robust to illumination conditions. We then extend this concept to a multi-camera system and present a new control algorithm to achieve both brightness consistency between adjacent cameras and a proper exposure level for each camera. We implement our prototype system with off-the-shelf machine-vision cameras and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on practical applications, including pedestrian detection, visual odometry, surround-view imaging, panoramic imaging and stereo matching. 

Title: Learning to Learn How to Learn: Self-Adaptive Visual Navigation Using Meta-Learning
Abstract:  Learning is an inherently continuous phenomenon. When humans learn a new task there is no explicit distinction between training and inference. As we learn a task, we keep learning about it while performing the task. What we learn and how we learn it varies during different stages of learning. Learning how to learn and adapt is a key property that enables us to generalize effortlessly to new settings. This is in contrast with conventional settings in machine learning where a trained model is frozen during inference. In this paper we study the problem of learning to learn at both training and test time in the context of visual navigation. A fundamental challenge in navigation is generalization to unseen scenes. In this paper we propose a self-adaptive visual navigation method (SAVN) which learns to adapt to new environments without any explicit supervision. Our solution is a meta-reinforcement learning approach where an agent learns a self-supervised interaction loss that encourages effective navigation. Our experiments, performed in the AI2-THOR framework, show major improvements in both success rate and SPL for visual navigation in novel scenes. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/allenai/savn . 

Title: Scene Classification in Indoor Environments for Robots using Context Based Word Embeddings
Abstract:  Scene Classification has been addressed with numerous techniques in computer vision literature. However, with the increasing number of scene classes in datasets in the field, it has become difficult to achieve high accuracy in the context of robotics. In this paper, we implement an approach which combines traditional deep learning techniques with natural language processing methods to generate a word embedding based Scene Classification algorithm. We use the key idea that context (objects in the scene) of an image should be representative of the scene label meaning a group of objects could assist to predict the scene class. Objects present in the scene are represented by vectors and the images are re-classified based on the objects present in the scene to refine the initial classification by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In our approach we address indoor Scene Classification task using a model trained with a reduced pre-processed version of the Places365 dataset and an empirical analysis is done on a real-world dataset that we built by capturing image sequences using a GoPro camera. We also report results obtained on a subset of the Places365 dataset using our approach and additionally show a deployment of our approach on a robot operating in a real-world environment. 

Title: Probabilistic Multimodal Modeling for Human-Robot Interaction Tasks
Abstract:  Human-robot interaction benefits greatly from multimodal sensor inputs as they enable increased robustness and generalization accuracy. Despite this observation, few HRI methods are capable of efficiently performing inference for multimodal systems. In this work, we introduce a reformulation of Interaction Primitives which allows for learning from demonstration of interaction tasks, while also gracefully handling nonlinearities inherent to multimodal inference in such scenarios. We also empirically show that our method results in more accurate, more robust, and faster inference than standard Interaction Primitives and other common methods in challenging HRI scenarios. 

Title: Nonparametric Continuous Sensor Registration
Abstract:  This paper develops a new mathematical framework that enables nonparametric joint semantic/appearance and geometric representation of continuous functions using data. The joint semantic and geometric embedding is modeled by representing the processes in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The framework allows the functions to be defined on arbitrary smooth manifolds where the action of a Lie group is used to align them. The continuous functions allow the registration to be independent of a specific signal resolution and the framework is fully analytical with a closed-form derivation of the Riemannian gradient and Hessian. We study a more specialized but widely used case where the Lie group acts on functions isometrically. We solve the problem by maximizing the inner product between two functions defined over data, while the continuous action of the rigid body motion Lie group is captured through the integration of the flow in the corresponding Lie algebra. Low-dimensional cases are derived with numerical examples to show the generality of the proposed framework. The high-dimensional derivation for the special Euclidean group acting on the Euclidean space showcases the point cloud registration and bird's-eye view map registration abilities. A specific derivation and implementation of this framework for RGB-D cameras outperform the state-of-the-art robust visual odometry and performs well in texture and structure-scares environments. 

Title: Reflectance Intensity Assisted Automatic and Accurate Extrinsic Calibration of 3D LiDAR and Panoramic Camera Using a Printed Chessboard
Abstract:  This paper presents a novel method for fully automatic and convenient extrinsic calibration of a 3D LiDAR and a panoramic camera with a normally printed chessboard. The proposed method is based on the 3D corner estimation of the chessboard from the sparse point cloud generated by one frame scan of the LiDAR. To estimate the corners, we formulate a full-scale model of the chessboard and fit it to the segmented 3D points of the chessboard. The model is fitted by optimizing the cost function under constraints of correlation between the reflectance intensity of laser and the color of the chessboard's patterns. Powell's method is introduced for resolving the discontinuity problem in optimization. The corners of the fitted model are considered as the 3D corners of the chessboard. Once the corners of the chessboard in the 3D point cloud are estimated, the extrinsic calibration of the two sensors is converted to a 3D-2D matching problem. The corresponding 3D-2D points are used to calculate the absolute pose of the two sensors with Unified Perspective-n-Point (UPnP). Further, the calculated parameters are regarded as initial values and are refined using the Levenberg-Marquardt method. The performance of the proposed corner detection method from the 3D point cloud is evaluated using simulations. The results of experiments, conducted on a Velodyne HDL-32e LiDAR and a Ladybug3 camera under the proposed re-projection error metric, qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the final extrinsic calibration parameters. 

Title: Path Integral Guided Policy Search
Abstract:  We present a policy search method for learning complex feedback control policies that map from high-dimensional sensory inputs to motor torques, for manipulation tasks with discontinuous contact dynamics. We build on a prior technique called guided policy search (GPS), which iteratively optimizes a set of local policies for specific instances of a task, and uses these to train a complex, high-dimensional global policy that generalizes across task instances. We extend GPS in the following ways: (1) we propose the use of a model-free local optimizer based on path integral stochastic optimal control (PI2), which enables us to learn local policies for tasks with highly discontinuous contact dynamics; and (2) we enable GPS to train on a new set of task instances in every iteration by using on-policy sampling: this increases the diversity of the instances that the policy is trained on, and is crucial for achieving good generalization. We show that these contributions enable us to learn deep neural network policies that can directly perform torque control from visual input. We validate the method on a challenging door opening task and a pick-and-place task, and we demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms the prior LQR-based local policy optimizer on these tasks. Furthermore, we show that on-policy sampling significantly increases the generalization ability of these policies. 

Title: Depth by Poking: Learning to Estimate Depth from Self-Supervised Grasping
Abstract:  Accurate depth estimation remains an open problem for robotic manipulation; even state of the art techniques including structured light and LiDAR sensors fail on reflective or transparent surfaces. We address this problem by training a neural network model to estimate depth from RGB-D images, using labels from physical interactions between a robot and its environment. Our network predicts, for each pixel in an input image, the z position that a robot's end effector would reach if it attempted to grasp or poke at the corresponding position. Given an autonomous grasping policy, our approach is self-supervised as end effector position labels can be recovered through forward kinematics, without human annotation. Although gathering such physical interaction data is expensive, it is necessary for training and routine operation of state of the art manipulation systems. Therefore, this depth estimator comes ``for free'' while collecting data for other tasks (e.g., grasping, pushing, placing). We show our approach achieves significantly lower root mean squared error than traditional structured light sensors and unsupervised deep learning methods on difficult, industry-scale jumbled bin datasets. 

Title: Rigid-Soft Interactive Learning for Robust Grasping
Abstract:  Inspired by widely used soft fingers on grasping, we propose a method of rigid-soft interactive learning, aiming at reducing the time of data collection. In this paper, we classify the interaction categories into Rigid-Rigid, Rigid-Soft, Soft-Rigid according to the interaction surface between grippers and target objects. We find experimental evidence that the interaction types between grippers and target objects play an essential role in the learning methods. We use soft, stuffed toys for training, instead of everyday objects, to reduce the integration complexity and computational burden and exploit such rigid-soft interaction by changing the gripper fingers to the soft ones when dealing with rigid, daily-life items such as the Yale-CMU-Berkeley (YCB) objects. With a small data collection of 5K picking attempts in total, our results suggest that such Rigid-Soft and Soft-Rigid interactions are transferable. Moreover, the combination of different grasp types shows better performance on the grasping test. We achieve the best grasping performance at 97.5\% for easy YCB objects and 81.3\% for difficult YCB objects while using a precise grasp with a two-soft-finger gripper to collect training data and power grasp with a four-soft-finger gripper to test. 

Title: Learning visual servo policies via planner cloning
Abstract:  Learning control policies for visual servoing in novel environments is an important problem. However, standard model-free policy learning methods are slow. This paper explores planner cloning: using behavior cloning to learn policies that mimic the behavior of a full-state motion planner in simulation. We propose Penalized Q Cloning (PQC), a new behavior cloning algorithm. We show that it outperforms several baselines and ablations on some challenging problems involving visual servoing in novel environments while avoiding obstacles. Finally, we demonstrate that these policies can be transferred effectively onto a real robotic platform, achieving approximately an 87% success rate both in simulation and on a real robot.
